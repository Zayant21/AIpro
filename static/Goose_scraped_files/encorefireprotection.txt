Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.

According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.

Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.

From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements. Encore is a licensed distributor of top brands in fire protection, including Gamewell-FCI. Encore also provides fire alarm solutions from any manufacturer you choose ensuring you get the right technology to protect your assets.

With more than 30-years experience, Encore is one of the oldest and most experienced fire protection companies in New England. Our team is equipped to design and install your buildings’ fire sprinkler system or provide test and inspection services for the system already in place.

Considered the most reliable fire protection system available, fire sprinklers are made up of a network of piping which carry pressurized water that discharges through sprinkler heads when the effects of a fire have been detected. According to NFPA, the vast majority of fires are contained with just 1 to 2 sprinkler heads activating.

Properly installed and maintained fire sprinklers are effective over 96% of the time and prevent widespread damage to your facility. Unfortunately, as recently as 2011, the National Fire Protection Association reported that only 10% of structural fires had properly maintained sprinklers present which lead to many cases of needless property damage and even injury and loss of life. Ensuring your facility’s fire sprinkler system is up to current codes and properly maintained is critical to mitigating the significant liability that fire conditions present every day.

Encore is the expert in the design and installation of all makes and models of fire sprinkler equipment. Our team of trained technicians can keep you in compliance through our testing and inspection services, and are available for 24/7 emergency service to keep your business up and running. We are licensed distributors of some of the leading fire sprinkler manufacturers, including Tyco, Ferguson, Reliable, Victaulic, and Viking, and can design a system that is right for your facility.
• Wet Systems – The simplest, most common method of fire sprinkler systems, wet systems consist of pipes that contain pressurized water that is deployed when fire or high temperatures are detected.
• Dry Systems – Pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, rather than water and are often used where system piping will be exposed to freezing temperatures. This air holds a remote valve in a closed position. The remote valve prevents water from entering the pipe until a fire causes a sprinkler head to activate releasing the air, opening the remote valve and delivering water to the activated sprinkler
• Fire Pumps – Fire pumps, usually powered by an electric, or diesel source, and drawing water from a public or private water supply, are used properly feed a sprinkler system when water pressure is not adequate.
• Sprinkler Heads – A key component to ensure effective heat detection and the release of water once a fire has been detected, it is important to ensure all sprinkler heads remain functional and compliant.
• Standpipes – This series of pipes connect to fire hose stations located throughout a building, allowing fire firefighters to access the water supply in the event of an emergency.
• Deluge Systems – Used in highly hazardous areas such power plants and processing facilities, deluge systems deploy water with a rapid, heavy response to extinguish fires.
• Pre-Action System – A two-step system that first identifies smoke, fire, or heat, pre-action systems then activate a pre-action valve that releases water flow onto the affected area. This two-step system is used in sensitive areas where water damage could be costly.

 Encore also offers: Jockey pumps, fire hydrants, foam systems, and backflow preventers.

Our team is OSHA trained, licensed, and certified to install and service systems in all six New England states. Each product and service offered by Encore is also compliant with the following:

Fire Suppression Systems offer a wide range of response to extinguishing fires in the most challenging hazard areas where a traditional water system would cause too much damage or down time.

When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.

New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.

Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.
• Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of nat urally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
• FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
• 3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid – A sustainable fire protection fluid and HFC alternative that works quickly, cleanly, and efficiently to help stop a fire before it starts.
• Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
• High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
• Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
• Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
• Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.
• Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.

Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.

Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the

pump and in the garage.explosion each year. Many fires start in vehicle engines, or by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, arcing and use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at vehicles, at the pumps, or in the garage, keeping your employees and customers safe. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored. These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.

In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.
Fire extinguishers are the first line of defense in the event of a fire, largely due to their accessibility and portability in any space. Per NFPA, your fire extinguishers are required to be inspected monthly and maintained annually, keeping your facility safe and compliant. Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.

Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
• Class A — Used for paper, wood, cloth, or other common trash fires
• Class B — Used for fires caused by petroleum, gasoline, oil, paint, propane and butane
• Class C — Used for fires caused by active electrical devices, fuse boxes, wiring, computers, and electrical sources
• Class K — Used for kitchen-based fires, which account for nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year

Encore sells, installs, services, tests, and inspects all makes and models of fire extinguishers in accordance with NFPA 10.
• Dry Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a dry chemical to smother and insulate combustible materials. The most common type of fire extinguisher, multipurpose ABC, fall into this category.
• Wet Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a liquid saponifying agent to create a chemical reaction that suffocates grease fires. Commonly referred to as Class K, these units are supplemental to kitchen fire suppression systems as required by NFPA 17A (Standard for Wet Chemical Extinguishing Systems).
• Clean Agent Hand Portables — These units use a gaseous agent to deplete oxygen around a fire, and are intended to leave minimal residue, thus extinguishing the fire and limiting damage to expensive equipment that ordinary liquid or powder extinguishers may cause.
• Stored-Pressure Water Hand Portables — Ideal for Class A fires involving common combustibles, this model allows for easy, cost-effective recharging.
• Wheeled Portable Extinguishing Units — These units are for larger hazards, usually used in commercial facilities with el5mb_6h20_lgevated hazards. They are equipped with a long hose and are mounted on a wheeled cart to allow for easy transportation of extinguishing agent quantities. These units can contain any type of extinguishing agent, Dry Chemical, Wet Chemical, Clean Agent and Foam.
