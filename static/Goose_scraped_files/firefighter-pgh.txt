Let us Light The Way.

Exit and Emergency Lighting provide assistance with lighting and direction in the case of an emergency. They use batteries as a secondary source of power to ensure they are operational during blackouts and other crisis.

This safety product is particularly important in poorly lit buildings with minimal natural light, as they guide people through the correct route in exiting the building. These products need to be inspected on an annual basis to ensure safety and continued operation.
