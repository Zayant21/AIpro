The System 3505 Prism LX™ is a highly integrated alarm monitoring system that uses state-of-the-art components and circuitry to continuously monitor and display the status of all connected alarms. When an alarm condition occurs, the System 3505 Prism LX™ presents it to the operating personnel via a programmable System 3505 Prism LX™ Monitoring System audible alarm, color graphic display and a permanent printed record on the thermal paper tape. The System 3505 Prism LX™ can monitor up to 500 active alarm points simultaneously, and in any combination of multiplex, telegraph / McCullough codes, direct-wire, digital dialer, network, polling radio, and serial input alarm signals, as well as Ethernet utilizing the AlarmLan. Options can be tailored to your installation’s precise needs.
The System 3505 Prism LX™ monitors three alarm categories: Zone, Dialer, and Box.  The AlarmLan option now allows zone inputs to be monitored via Ethernet. Direct Wire zone inputs are monitored via EOL or RPI input cards. Multiplex zone inputs are monitored via Data Gathering Panels/Muxpads via relay contacts and or by monitoring the serial output of connected fire alarm panels. Polling radio zones are monitored via Radio Data Gathering Panels. Dialers are monitored via Digitize DDI-11e Dialer Receiver. Box alarms are monitored via telegraph / McCullough coded boxes or 1221 Radio interface card.  
The SYSTEM 3505 Prism LX™ can store 30,000 screens of user programmable. All user data is maintained in the event of a power failure, including the loss of battery backup. Editing user memory can be performed with an external USB keyboard, with the WIN3505 software and uploaded to any Prism unit via it’s built WEB browser in a second or two while the Prism LX is still monitoring events. Relay control is available to control fans, doors and output modules.  Programmable point output controls up to 2,048 output points, either remotely or at the System 3505 Prism LX location. 
Used as a standalone unit or connected in a network of multiple System 3505 Prism LX’s, the System 3505 Prism LX™ is designed for fire alarm reporting, security alarm monitoring and building management.  A dedicated proprietary alarm monitoring system, the System 3505 Prism LX™ has been expressly developed for single ownership applications, such as universities, military bases, municipalities, hospitals, industrial complexes, and other multi-building campus facilities.
The Remote Annunciator offers an interactive audio/visual display of System 3505 Prism LX™ activity at a remote location. Multiple Remote Annunciators can be added to the system, distributing the information to many locations. Remote Annunciator options include automatic Text-2-Cell & E-mail notification. 
The Digitize AlarmLan option allows the System 3505 Prism LX™ to communicate with equipment practically anywhere in the world via Ethernet. Multiple 3505’s can be connected as a network, each 3505 functioning as an Alarm Server.  
The Test Mode Option masks user specified alarms by alarm point, groups of alarm points, or buildings, for a user specified time not to exceed 8 hours.
Software Support – The encrypted Prism LX Software updates are available on the Digitize WEB site to users with active software support agreements. Updates include any changes to the Linux system as well as the Prism LX and install via the built in WEB browser.
Additional and Custom Options are available for the System 3505 Prism LX.  Please consult with the factory

Digitize System 3505 Prism LX

 

The System 3505 Prism LX™ is a highly integrated alarm monitoring system that uses state-of-the-art components and circuitry to continuously monitor and display the status of all connected alarms. When an alarm condition occurs, the System 3505 Prism LX™ presents it to the operating personnel via a programmable System 3505 Prism LX™ Monitoring System audible alarm, color graphic display and a permanent printed record on the thermal paper tape. The System 3505 Prism LX™ can monitor up to 500 active alarm points simultaneously, and in any combination of multiplex, telegraph / McCullough codes, direct-wire, digital dialer, network, polling radio, and serial input alarm signals, as well as Ethernet utilizing the AlarmLan. Options can be tailored to your installation’s precise needs.

 
 



 
 



The System 3505 Prism LX™ monitors three alarm categories: Zone, Dialer, and Box.  The AlarmLan option now allows zone inputs to be monitored via Ethernet. Direct Wire zone inputs are monitored via EOL or RPI input cards. Multiplex zone inputs are monitored via Data Gathering Panels/Muxpads via relay contacts and or by monitoring the serial output of connected fire alarm panels. Polling radio zones are monitored via Radio Data Gathering Panels. Dialers are monitored via Digitize DDI-11e Dialer Receiver. Box alarms are monitored via telegraph / McCullough coded boxes or 1221 Radio interface card.  
The SYSTEM 3505 Prism LX™ can store 30,000 screens of user programmable. All user data is maintained in the event of a power failure, including the loss of battery backup. Editing user memory can be performed with an external USB keyboard, with the WIN3505 software and uploaded to any Prism unit via it’s built WEB browser in a second or two while the Prism LX is still monitoring events. Relay control is available to control fans, doors and output modules.  Programmable point output controls up to 2,048 output points, either remotely or at the System 3505 Prism LX location. 

 
 
 



ApplicationsEnhancements




Used as a standalone unit or connected in a network of multiple System 3505 Prism LX’s, the System 3505 Prism LX™ is designed for fire alarm reporting, security alarm monitoring and building management.  A dedicated proprietary alarm monitoring system, the System 3505 Prism LX™ has been expressly developed for single ownership applications, such as universities, military bases, municipalities, hospitals, industrial complexes, and other multi-building campus facilities.

 

The Remote Annunciator offers an interactive audio/visual display of System 3505 Prism LX™ activity at a remote location. Multiple Remote Annunciators can be added to the system, distributing the information to many locations. Remote Annunciator options include automatic Text-2-Cell & E-mail notification. 
The Digitize AlarmLan option allows the System 3505 Prism LX™ to communicate with equipment practically anywhere in the world via Ethernet. Multiple 3505’s can be connected as a network, each 3505 functioning as an Alarm Server.  
The Test Mode Option masks user specified alarms by alarm point, groups of alarm points, or buildings, for a user specified time not to exceed 8 hours.
Software Support – The encrypted Prism LX Software updates are available on the Digitize WEB site to users with active software support agreements. Updates include any changes to the Linux system as well as the Prism LX and install via the built in WEB browser.
Additional and Custom Options are available for the System 3505 Prism LX.  Please consult with the factory

The System 3505 Prism LX™ monitors three alarm categories: Zone, Dialer, and Box.  The AlarmLan option now allows zone inputs to be monitored via Ethernet. Direct Wire zone inputs are monitored via EOL or RPI input cards. Multiplex zone inputs are monitored via Data Gathering Panels/Muxpads via relay contacts and or by monitoring the serial output of connected fire alarm panels. Polling radio zones are monitored via Radio Data Gathering Panels. Dialers are monitored via Digitize DDI-11e Dialer Receiver. Box alarms are monitored via telegraph / McCullough coded boxes or 1221 Radio interface card.  
The SYSTEM 3505 Prism LX™ can store 30,000 screens of user programmable. All user data is maintained in the event of a power failure, including the loss of battery backup. Editing user memory can be performed with an external USB keyboard, with the WIN3505 software and uploaded to any Prism unit via it’s built WEB browser in a second or two while the Prism LX is still monitoring events. Relay control is available to control fans, doors and output modules.  Programmable point output controls up to 2,048 output points, either remotely or at the System 3505 Prism LX location.

The Digitize Multiplex System allows you to mix and match any multiplex panel (DGM or Muxpad II) offered by Digitize. Multiplex panels using supervised, bi-directional, polling multiplex protocols.  DGM/MuxpadIIs can be connected to a variety of communication media including: single or multi-mode fiber optic, audio modem, dry cable pair, polling radio, Ethernet, and wireless mesh Ethernet network. The Multiplex option allows the System 3505 Prism LX to connect to 500 Data Gathering Modules (DGM) or Muxpad IIs.
Supervised By-directional Polling multiplexing capability provides the user with a two-way communication protocol. This allows the System 3505 Prism LX to control relays within the DGM/Muxpad II panels
DGM (Data Gathering Module) panels are available from 8 to 64 zones for connection to dry-contacts with end of line (EOL) supervision and through serial interfaces to addressable control panels.
The Digitize Muxpad II allows connections of various manufacturers’ addressable control panels into one proprietary alarm monitoring system.Muxpad IIs provide the Fire Alarm Control Panels exact text to be sent to the System 3505 Prism LX.
The mix and match capability allows integration of old and new panels into the same system.
Any DGM/Muxpad II can be ordered with any communication protocol.
Every DGM or Muxpad II is supplied with a single relay controlled by System 3505 Prism LX (with the relay control option).
The DGM Multiplex system cannot be intermixed on the same line as the Q-Mux multiplex system.

The Q-Mux is a low cost multiplex system.  Two wires are used to power the IDM sensor modules (i.e.. Q-1C, Q-1A, Q-1CL, Q-1R, Q-I/O, Q-EOL,Q-SNP-RLY and Q-SNP-EOL) to send commands to the modules and receive their data.  Commands from the Q-Mux Node to the ID modules take the form of modulating Buss voltages between 0 and 10v.  The data returned from the modules is increased Buss current.
Each Q-Mux node can control up to 99 mix/matched IDM modules.  Up to 32 Q-Mux Nodes may be used in one system.  Total range of the Q-Mux system is 5,000 feet from the System 3505 PRISM LX to the last Q-Mux Node and 5,000 feet from the Q-Mux Node to the last ID module.  ID modules may be set to any address from one to 99.  ID addresses are stored on an internal EEPROM and can be changed by the Q-Mux Programmer (P/N 425184-0002).
The Q-Mux Option (P/N 010001-0094) or Q-Mux option w/32 Line Driver Rack P/N 010001-0099 and a minimum of one Q-Mux node (P/N 425190-0001) are required for the System 3505 PRISM LX.

Q-Mux Monitor & Control Modules

 

The Q-Mux is a low cost multiplex system.  Two wires are used to power the IDM sensor modules (i.e.. Q-1C, Q-1A, Q-1CL, Q-1R, Q-I/O, Q-EOL,Q-SNP-RLY and Q-SNP-EOL) to send commands to the modules and receive their data.  Commands from the Q-Mux Node to the ID modules take the form of modulating Buss voltages between 0 and 10v.  The data returned from the modules is increased Buss current.
Each Q-Mux node can control up to 99 mix/matched IDM modules.  Up to 32 Q-Mux Nodes may be used in one system.  Total range of the Q-Mux system is 5,000 feet from the System 3505 PRISM LX to the last Q-Mux Node and 5,000 feet from the Q-Mux Node to the last ID module.  ID modules may be set to any address from one to 99.  ID addresses are stored on an internal EEPROM and can be changed by the Q-Mux Programmer (P/N 425184-0002).
The Q-Mux Option (P/N 010001-0094) or Q-Mux option w/32 Line Driver Rack P/N 010001-0099 and a minimum of one Q-Mux node (P/N 425190-0001) are required for the System 3505 PRISM LX.

The Card Cage provides the housing for one common card, and up to 10 Box or Alarm cards in any combination. The Form Four Box Card supplies supervisory and control logic for repeating alarms to bell or recording circuits.  It also automatically provides ground return capability for the reception of alarms from “Three Fold” type fire alarm boxes in the in the event of an open circuit.
The DET-6B  and DET-12B are indoor, mounted, six-zone or twelve zone, solid-state telegraph transmitters that employ a unique code for each zone.  It includes a CAM lock, AC transformer, standby battery and built-in charger. The unit is housed in a steel enclosure suitable for indoor mounting. Telegraph codes unique to each of the six zones for Trouble, Alarm and Secure, and Low Battery are transmitted over a 100-milliampere circuit using positive non-interfering successive (PNIS) line current detection to avoid clashes between more than one transmitting-box. Automatic ground return, a watchdog timer, and a jumper-selected internal trouble buzzer assure continued main system operation and operator notification in the event of box failure. A built-in trouble relay output (Form C) and the ground and code relay (grounding, opening, or no effect on the 100 MA line) are activated by the watchdog timer ensuring reliable failure detection in the event of malfunction.
The DET-6-C is a 6-channel EOL transmitter in cottage shell housing.  It includes a CAM loc, AC transformer, standby battery, and built-in charger.  The unit is housed in a durable cottage shell enclosure suitable for outdoor mounting. Telegraph codes unique to each of the six zones for Trouble, Alarm, Secure, as well as Tamper and Low Battery are transmitted over 100 milliampere circuit using positive non-interfering successive (PNIS) line current detection to avoid clashes between more than one transmitting box.  Automatic ground return, a watchdog timer, and a jumper selected internal trouble buzzer assure continued main system operation and operator notification in the event of box failure. A built-in trouble relay output (form C) and the ground and code relay (grounding, opening, or no effect on the 100MA line) are activated by the watchdog timer ensuring reliable failure detection in the event of malfunction.
The DET-16 is an indoor mounted sixteen-zone solid state telegraph transmitter that employs a unique code for each zone. It includes a CAM lock, display and keypad, AC transformer, standby battery and built-in charger. The unit is housed in a steel enclosure suitable for indoor mounting. Telegraph codes unique to each of the sixteen zones for Alarm, Trouble, and Secure, Low Battery, & AC Power Failure are transmitted over 100 milliampere circuit using positive non-interfering successive (PNIS) line current detection to avoid clashes between more than one transmitting box. Automatic ground return, a watchdog timer, and a software selected internal trouble buzzer assure continued main system operation and operator notification in the event of box failure.  NFPA-72 compliant.

he DDI-11E is a dual line external Digitial Alarm Communicator Reciever (DACR) module capable of processing Contact ID and other formated account information. Only one DDI-11E may be connected to a System 3505 Prism LX.
The Digital Dialer interface option allows the System 3505 Prism LX to receive alarms through the dial up telephone network. The dialer option software provides conversion of coded information from the receiver into the proper format for processing by the System 3505 Prism LX.. Additionally the DDI Option has the capability to receive 1600  Digital Alarm Communicator Transmitters (DACTs) and provide on-demand or scheduled Daily Exception Test Reports on all existing and future DACT’s

The DDI-11E has a new design with a graphic LCD that allows users to see all key status at a glance.  Events memory has been expanded to 4,095 events, with fast scroll on the screen dispaly.
The DDI-11E is a dual-line external DACR module (P/N 425196-0005 and 425196-0002) that will accept any pulsed dialer rate from 10 to 40 (37) PPS using the 3-1, 3-1 extended, 4-1, 4-1 extended formats. See below for a complete listing.
The DDI-11E replaces the DDI-10E, which is no longer available.  The DDI-11E requires the latest System 3505/System 3505 Prism LX  with 9th Edition requirements and an August 2012 or later software release.

Perfect for mid to large-sized jobs such as schools and universities, hospitals and hotels, The Farenhyt IFP-1000 offers over 1,000 addressable points. And, since it works with a building’s existing wiring, the system is ideally suited for retrofit jobs as well. By integrating intelligent addressable technology, a built-in digital communicator and powerful facility management software, the IFP-1000 enables you to do more than react to a building’s fire response system – you’re able to proactively manage it. Let’s take a look at some of the features and benefits that set the IFP-1000 apart from other fire alarm panels.

IFP-1000 

 

Perfect for mid to large-sized jobs such as schools and universities, hospitals and hotels, The Farenhyt IFP-1000 offers over 1,000 addressable points. And, since it works with a building’s existing wiring, the system is ideally suited for retrofit jobs as well. By integrating intelligent addressable technology, a built-in digital communicator and powerful facility management software, the IFP-1000 enables you to do more than react to a building’s fire response system – you’re able to proactively manage it. Let’s take a look at some of the features and benefits that set the IFP-1000 apart from other fire alarm panels.

IFP-100 

 

The Farenhyt IFP-100 offers built-in addressable support for up to127 Hochiki devices or 99 IDP detectors and 99 IDP modules. And, since it works with a building’s existing wiring, the system is ideally suited for retrofit jobs as well. By integrating intelligent addressable technology, a built-in digital communicator and powerful facility management software, the IFP-100 enables you to do more than react to a building’s fire response system – you’re able to proactively manage it. Let’s take a look at some of the features and benefits that sets the IFP-100 apart from other fire alarm panels.

IFP-50 

 

The Farenhyt IFP-50 offers built-in addressable support for up to 50 Hochiki devices or 50 IDP detectors and 50 IDP modules. And, since it works with a building’s existing wiring, the system is ideally suited for retrofit jobs as well. By integrating intelligent addressable technology, a built-in digital communicator and powerful facility management software, the IFP-50 enables you to do more than react to a building’s fire response system – you’re able to proactively manage it. Let’s take a look at some of the features and benefits that sets the IFP-50 apart from other fire alarm panels.
