Firetrol Protection Systems is a leading fire protection, life safety and security company. Our full service company designs, installs, repairs, services, and inspects a wide variety of fire suppression, life protection, and integrated security systems.
Defining a path to your fire protection, life safety and integrated security solutions
 
Aligning your immediate needs, plans for the future, and budget with complex issues such as changing code requirements, advancements in features and equipment abilities, life cycle maintenance costs, and integration into your operation requires a skilled team of professionals.
 
Our design and engineering teams constantly seek to deliver a comprehensive solution that integrates the best technology available to meet your needs while ensuring that we deliver a constructible and valuable solution.
Turn-key Solutions for your Fire Protection, Life Safety & Integrated Systems
 
Understanding your businesses needs is the first step in providing a solution that integrates into your operation efficiently and affordably. Our consulting, design and estimating personnel can review, advise and help you plan out your approach and budget.
 
Once the goals are defined, the success of a project can often be ascribed to two factors, the safe execution of the work and clear communication between the project teams. To achieve these, we have dedicated personnel to consult, design, install, manage and commission your systems safely and efficiently.  Our teams have experience working directly with owners, as well as general contractors and consultants to deliver projects on time and budget.
Trust Our Experts to Inspect Your Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems
 
Fire protection and life safety systems are required to be inspected by licensed personnel in accordance with national and local codes, authorities having jurisdiction, underwriters and other regulatory authorities.
​
Our teams of licensed inspectors are able to perform all of the necessary tests to ensure your system is working as intended and provide you with the documentation and history necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements and provide peace of mind that your fire protection and life safety systems are working properly. This is why we offer the ability to access your current and historical information digitally via our ServiceTrade Portal so you always have this information when you need it most. We also provide options that can  generate reports that are designed to meet specific requirements, such as JACO, FM Global and others.
​
Protecting your people, facilities, and physical assets from fire is a fundamental responsibility of any business. Completing regularly scheduled testing and servicing of your fire protection and life safety systems is the most cost-effective way to maintain the integrity of your system while also meeting the requirements mandated by national, state, and local fire agencies and by most insurance providers.

Firetrol service teams offer the necessary peace of mind by professionally executing all inspections, maintenance, and repair work. In addition to maintenance, we offer specific measures and programs to ensure that your systems and equipment continue to function correctly and corresponds to the latest technological developments even after years on standby.

Firetrol of­fers a complete range of fire protection systems and components. These meet the highest requirements and with Firetrol's expertise, can be combined into an effective and economic solution.
Fire alarm and detection systems are the cornerstone of any fire protection system.  They are trusted to provide advanced warning and evacuation in the event of a fire. The consequences of a malfunctioning fire detection system can result in a devastating loss of life and property. 
Clean agent systems utilize inert, non-conductive agents or gases to protect defined spaces with minimal impact to equipment or operations. They are especially common in occupied areas where occupant safety and asset protection are critical and effectively extinguish fires without causing any damage to sensitive or electrical equipment.
Firetrol Protection Systems' custom sprinkler systems are designed for each particular facility and are built to meet or exceed fire codes and insurance requirements. Our team of engineers and technicians can install, maintain and service wet fire sprinkler systems, dry pipe systems, pre-action systems, underground supplies, standpipe systems, and fire pumps.
Firetrol Protection Systems offers a wide array of integrated security solutions that are scalable from the large enterprise systems to small business applications.  Firetrol also has established manufacturer distributorships with industry leading product lines to ensure our customers’ needs are addressed by the best technology.
Because we are not an equipment manufacturer, Firetrol Protection Systems provides unbiased recommendations for the system that will best protect your people and facilities. Our customers receive the highest level of protection without the need to commit to a service provider that only offers proprietary equipment and software. We work with a wide variety of distributors.

Structural fires in the United States have declined in number by nearly 40 percent over the last twenty years. Properly installed and maintained fire protection systems have played a significant role in driving this reduction. Protecting your people, facilities, and physical assets from fire is a fundamental responsibility of any business and Firetrol Protection Systems has the in-house expertise and resources to ensure that you're protected and in compliance.
TECHNOLOGIES
Firetrol maintains a staff of dedicated professionals that are trained and certified to design, install and maintain fire protection that allow us to bring value from the inception of our clients projects with budgeting, conceptual design, and code compliance/review. These steps build the foundation for successful projects by making sure that budgets are met, schedules are maintained and occupancy is approved by the governing authorities. Once installed, we continue to provide support to our team by providing the inspections, maintenance, and service necessary to ensure that the system is in good working order and provide the documentation you need to confirm that your facility is in compliance.
Fire protection and sprinkler systems must be able to perform in different environments and provide protection for various types of hazards. In order to accomplish this, we work with a number of manufacturers and distributors to bring together the best technology with proven performance to provide solutions like:
​
Wet Systems
Dry Systems
Pre-Action Systems
Deluge Systems
Standpipe / Hose systems
Fire Line Equipment
Fire Pumps and Water Storage
Backflow Preventers
