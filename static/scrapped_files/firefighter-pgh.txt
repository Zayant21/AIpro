“Your team did a great job and went above and beyond to help with my system!”
~Ryan, psychiatric facility
“Your tech is professional and friendly. He performs the technical functions, while also communicating in a way for us to understand.
It’s rare to possess both the technical and customer service skills which he displays during each visit.
He genuinely cares that the work gets done correctly and takes time to educate us. He is an excellent Fire Fighter representative and we appreciate all that he does for us.”
~Laura, moving company
“Your company has done an outstanding job for me over the years. The service people are your front line and they perform outstandingly.
But most important is the paperwork that must be maintained in the proper format and our account rep at Fire Fighter is on top of his game for this, he is timely and always open for a site visit to review.
As management myself, we are only as good as our team and you have a good team.”
~Dan, healthcare facility
“Your techs recently completed a fire alarm install, they are a great team and Fire Fighter is lucky to have them.”
~Sean, religious institution
“In all my years, I’ve never seen a crew of guys work as good and professionally as your team did. He couldn’t have been more impressed.”
~Karen, car dealership 
“Your staff was great to work with!”
~Brent, apartment complex
“The techs did a great job installing a new pre-piped kitchen hood system and were very professional.”

“Your team did a great job and went above and beyond to help with my system!”
~Ryan, psychiatric facility








“Your tech is professional and friendly. He performs the technical functions, while also communicating in a way for us to understand.
It’s rare to possess both the technical and customer service skills which he displays during each visit.

“Your company has done an outstanding job for me over the years. The service people are your front line and they perform outstandingly.
But most important is the paperwork that must be maintained in the proper format and our account rep at Fire Fighter is on top of his game for this, he is timely and always open for a site visit to review.
As management myself, we are only as good as our team and you have a good team.”
~Dan, healthcare facility








“Your techs recently completed a fire alarm install, they are a great team and Fire Fighter is lucky to have them.”

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING






“Your team did a great job and went above and beyond to help with my system!”
~Ryan, psychiatric facility








“Your tech is professional and friendly. He performs the technical functions, while also communicating in a way for us to understand.
It’s rare to possess both the technical and customer service skills which he displays during each visit.
He genuinely cares that the work gets done correctly and takes time to educate us. He is an excellent Fire Fighter representative and we appreciate all that he does for us.”
~Laura, moving company








“Your company has done an outstanding job for me over the years. The service people are your front line and they perform outstandingly.
But most important is the paperwork that must be maintained in the proper format and our account rep at Fire Fighter is on top of his game for this, he is timely and always open for a site visit to review.
As management myself, we are only as good as our team and you have a good team.”
~Dan, healthcare facility








“Your techs recently completed a fire alarm install, they are a great team and Fire Fighter is lucky to have them.”
~Sean, religious institution








“In all my years, I’ve never seen a crew of guys work as good and professionally as your team did. He couldn’t have been more impressed.”
~Karen, car dealership 








“Your staff was great to work with!”
~Brent, apartment complex








“The techs did a great job installing a new pre-piped kitchen hood system and were very professional.”
~Ray, construction company

DETECTION SYSTEMS
Don’t Leave Your Safety Up To Chance.
Fire Fighter’s professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to alert you at the first sign of a fire.  
All system designs are reviewed by NICET (National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies) certified technicians, a recognized standard of excellence. Our field personnel are factory trained on the products we sell to ensure the very best service for our customers, from project concept to acceptance testing.
After installation, we continue to provide protection by regularly testing and inspecting your systems to make certain they are operating properly. 
Fire Fighter is a proud distributor of Notifier, Fike, Kidde, System Sensor, Wheelock, Firelite, Silent Knight, Potter and Gentex. 









Fire Fighter Offers The Following Types of Detection Systems:








DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEMS
Building fire alarm systems range from small, conventional systems to large computer-based intelligent, networked systems. Fire Fighter provides the analysis, design, and installation of systems best suited to provide a reliable, code-compliant, and cost-effective solution. We will furnish and install mass notification alerting systems for commercial, industrial, and education facilities in addition to the recommended fire alarm system for your property. 








FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS
Our professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to protect a wide variety of standard and special hazard systems. 








VOICE EVACUATION SYSTEMS
The main difference between voice evacuation systems and a traditional fire alarm system is the spoken message voice evacuation systems use rather than strobes and sirens. The blare of traditional alarms can often be stressful, anxiety-provoking, and panic-inducing, causing a chaotic evacuation. The simple sound of an active alarm does not provide direction for evacuation and is limited to loud sirens and bright strobes lights. Voice evacuation technology helps diminish fear by guiding occupants out of the building using clear and coherent direction through the safest route. 










MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS
A mass notification system can provide a multi-faceted approach to notify occupants and personnel of any type of emergency or non-emergency event in real time. We can provide the ability to easily integrate indoor and outdoor voice evacuation with pre-recorded messages or live announcements performed locally or via wide area networking over IP. Plus, the ability to integrate Distributed Recipient Mass Notification Systems (DRMNS) that deliver the appropriate message via text, email, SMS, digital displays, LED Signs and/or PC screens. Fire Fighter’s mass notification offering ensures that the right message is received by the right people, at the right time, using the appropriate technology.








MONITORING
Fire alarm monitoring is an essential part of a fire protection system. When a fire alarm goes off in your building, monitoring ensures that the signal is quickly assessed to verify that it is not a false alarm and then communicated to a first responder within minutes. Knowing that your fire alarm system requires monitoring is the first step to ensuring it will protect your building and your business if a fire ever breaks out. We offer 24-hour monitoring service for your fire alarm systems by means of cellular, IP (internet protocol) or POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service).

DETECTION SYSTEMS
Don’t Leave Your Safety Up To Chance.
Fire Fighter’s professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to alert you at the first sign of a fire.  
All system designs are reviewed by NICET (National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies) certified technicians, a recognized standard of excellence. Our field personnel are factory trained on the products we sell to ensure the very best service for our customers, from project concept to acceptance testing.
After installation, we continue to provide protection by regularly testing and inspecting your systems to make certain they are operating properly. 
Fire Fighter is a proud distributor of Notifier, Fike, Kidde, System Sensor, Wheelock, Firelite, Silent Knight, Potter and Gentex. 









Fire Fighter Offers The Following Types of Detection Systems:








DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEMS
Building fire alarm systems range from small, conventional systems to large computer-based intelligent, networked systems. Fire Fighter provides the analysis, design, and installation of systems best suited to provide a reliable, code-compliant, and cost-effective solution. We will furnish and install mass notification alerting systems for commercial, industrial, and education facilities in addition to the recommended fire alarm system for your property. 








FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS
Our professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to protect a wide variety of standard and special hazard systems. 








VOICE EVACUATION SYSTEMS
The main difference between voice evacuation systems and a traditional fire alarm system is the spoken message voice evacuation systems use rather than strobes and sirens. The blare of traditional alarms can often be stressful, anxiety-provoking, and panic-inducing, causing a chaotic evacuation. The simple sound of an active alarm does not provide direction for evacuation and is limited to loud sirens and bright strobes lights. Voice evacuation technology helps diminish fear by guiding occupants out of the building using clear and coherent direction through the safest route. 










MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS
A mass notification system can provide a multi-faceted approach to notify occupants and personnel of any type of emergency or non-emergency event in real time. We can provide the ability to easily integrate indoor and outdoor voice evacuation with pre-recorded messages or live announcements performed locally or via wide area networking over IP. Plus, the ability to integrate Distributed Recipient Mass Notification Systems (DRMNS) that deliver the appropriate message via text, email, SMS, digital displays, LED Signs and/or PC screens. Fire Fighter’s mass notification offering ensures that the right message is received by the right people, at the right time, using the appropriate technology.

When a fire alarm goes off in your building, monitoring ensures that the signal is quickly assessed to verify that it is not a false alarm and then communicated to a first responder within minutes. Knowing that your fire alarm system requires monitoring is the first step to ensuring it will protect your building and your business if a fire ever breaks out. We offer 24-hour monitoring service for your fire alarm systems by means of cellular, IP (internet protocol) or POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service).

Exit and Emergency Lighting provide assistance with lighting and direction in the case of an emergency. They use batteries as a secondary source of power to ensure they are operational during blackouts and other crisis.
This safety product is particularly important in poorly lit buildings with minimal natural light, as they guide people through the correct route in exiting the building. These products need to be inspected on an annual basis to ensure safety and continued operation.
We offer installation of new or replacement units where equipment can be surface mounted on the wall or ceiling provided there is an existing electrical connection or junction box. 
NFPA requires that emergency lighting be checked monthly for a 30 second functionality test and annually for a 90-minute discharge test. We can provide these services along with documentation of the maintenance. Our technicians carry replacement batteries and bulbs to meet your equipment’s requirements, and we can also test the charging system to verify it is able to maintain your new replacement battery. 
We carry replacement units for standard and LED emergency lighting units, exit signs, combination signs (exit with spotlights), and remote indoor or outdoor spot lights.

Regular, periodic inspection, and testing are the best defense against system failure so that you may continue to operate your business securely and efficiently.  Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company keeps track of your inspection due dates and notifies you when it is time for your system to be serviced so you don’t have to. Our well-trained staff will keep your property code compliant and operational at all times.
An annual visual inspection is required for all fire extinguishers with additional testing applying every six and twelve years. This will ensure proper test dates and no indication of damage that would hamper function. 
Our certified technicians will test devices, batteries, pull stations, smoke/heat/duct detectors, horns/strobes, flow switches and tampers at your required annual inspection. 
These systems require a semi-annual inspection to check all cylinders, gauges and cartridges. If detection links need to be replaced, our techs can do so on-site at the time of service. 
Exit and emergency lights require an annual inspection to verify function, battery reserve capacity and proper changing. All batteries, bulbs or units may be replaced if necessary. 
Inspections for sprinkler systems and equipment frequency varies on a per item basis. All testing and inspections are completed per NFPA 25 requirements. Sprinkler guidelines can be found here.
A visual inspection along with a hose removal and re-rack are required annually. Additional pressure testing is required five years from the date of manufacturing and then every three years thereafter.

Our NICET certified technicians are experts in system integration and our capabilities will allow you to have more centralized control over your your life safety and security systems. 
From clients with single sites to large global firms, the professionals at Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company will use an in-depth analysis to create a customized electronic security solution specific for you. 
Whether it be during business hours or after, it is crucial that no unauthorized personnel enter your facility to prevent any unwanted activity. Fire Fighter’s complete installation of a card access system will enhance your overall protection plan. While keys are easily lost or stolen and the changing of all locks and distribution of new keys would be inefficient and costly, card access has the capabilities to activate and deactivate cards when necessary as well as keep tabs on who is in and out of the office in the event of an emergency. Other benefits of card access systems are controlled entry into authorized areas, hard and soft anti-pass back, and input/output linking.
Whether you are in need of controlled access to proprietary information, document control, or medical records, Fire Fighter offers an extensive line of Access Control Systems to manage your facility. Our systems include biometric and HID Proximity Readers, Gate Control, Metal Detection, Photo ID Badge and Physical and Optical Turnstiles. Our professionals will guide you through the process from implementation, installation and training to ensure you have the right equipment for your specific needs. 
Each industry is faced with its own unique set of security issues. IP video systems and video management can be used to provide security for improved safety, as a deterrent for vandalism and loss prevention. 
Fire Fighter’s technology allows you to achieve greater security with high quality video and detail including facial recognition, the ability to discern license plates and thermal imaging for clearer images at night. Our experts have extensive knowledge and experience working with a variety of industries and will provide you with a customized security solution to minimize risk. 
Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company will provide system integration, service and maintenance to ensure your equipment is performing optimally. We offer a wide variety of network cameras to provide you with the best combination for your property. 
From fixed, to Pan/Tilt/Zoom, to HD and Thermal we have exactly what you need, and our team can assist you with maximizing your network capabilities for remote viewing, recording and event management. 
Intrusion detection systems create a strong defense with visible deterrents and hidden sensors to provide security to your business. Fire Fighter’s professionals will help you secure the premises with a range of technology and equipment that work together to alert you at the first sign of an attempted intrusion. 
With door contacts, glass break detectors, motion detectors and outdoor surveillance cameras, your property is fully prepared to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing your building. Fire Fighter’s expert staff provides design, installation and servicing of your intrusion systems. 
Extensive cable networks are a large part of all business activity and communication, so it is crucial these are working properly. 
Our team at Fire Fighter will install a standard compliant structured cabling system to eliminate extensive down time and ensuring business processes and employee productivity are functioning at their best. 
Our professionals will perform a project assessment and have the knowledge to take care of your specific business needs.
Indoor air is recirculated over and over again, and can contain viruses, bacteria, mold and contamination.
A proper air filtration system can detect indoor and outdoor air quality in real-time to target and disinfect 99.9% of airborne particles.
We install and service Aura Air intelligent air filters that can help minimize your exposure to these harmful particles, monitor your air quality in real time, and keep you, your staff, and your customers breathing cleaner air.
 
When you can’t place a camera or record conversations in an area with privacy concerns, it can be a challenge to keep that area secure. 
We install and service HALO Smart Sensors in privacy areas, which can detect gunshots, check air quality, and react based on a spoken keyword.  
 If environmental changes are detected in these privacy concern areas, these sensors can send email, text and security platform alerts to designated security personnel.

Privacy Area Security Sensors
When you can’t place a camera or record conversations in an area with privacy concerns, it can be a challenge to keep that area secure. 
We install and service HALO Smart Sensors in privacy areas, which can detect gunshots, check air quality, and react based on a spoken keyword.  
 If environmental changes are detected in these privacy concern areas, these sensors can send email, text and security platform alerts to designated security personnel.

ELECTRONIC SAFETY
Don’t Leave Your Security Up To Chance.
Don’t leave your security up to chance.  Fire Fighter offers access control, video surveillance, intrusion detection and much more to provide you with the best solution possible to keep your property safe and secure. 
Our NICET certified technicians are experts in system integration and our capabilities will allow you to have more centralized control over your your life safety and security systems. 
From clients with single sites to large global firms, the professionals at Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company will use an in-depth analysis to create a customized electronic security solution specific for you. 









Fire Fighter Offers The Following Types of Electronic Safety Systems:








CARD ACCESS
Whether it be during business hours or after, it is crucial that no unauthorized personnel enter your facility to prevent any unwanted activity. Fire Fighter’s complete installation of a card access system will enhance your overall protection plan. While keys are easily lost or stolen and the changing of all locks and distribution of new keys would be inefficient and costly, card access has the capabilities to activate and deactivate cards when necessary as well as keep tabs on who is in and out of the office in the event of an emergency. Other benefits of card access systems are controlled entry into authorized areas, hard and soft anti-pass back, and input/output linking.
Whether you are in need of controlled access to proprietary information, document control, or medical records, Fire Fighter offers an extensive line of Access Control Systems to manage your facility. Our systems include biometric and HID Proximity Readers, Gate Control, Metal Detection, Photo ID Badge and Physical and Optical Turnstiles. Our professionals will guide you through the process from implementation, installation and training to ensure you have the right equipment for your specific needs. 








SURVEILLANCE
Each industry is faced with its own unique set of security issues. IP video systems and video management can be used to provide security for improved safety, as a deterrent for vandalism and loss prevention. 
Fire Fighter’s technology allows you to achieve greater security with high quality video and detail including facial recognition, the ability to discern license plates and thermal imaging for clearer images at night. Our experts have extensive knowledge and experience working with a variety of industries and will provide you with a customized security solution to minimize risk. 
Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company will provide system integration, service and maintenance to ensure your equipment is performing optimally. We offer a wide variety of network cameras to provide you with the best combination for your property. 
From fixed, to Pan/Tilt/Zoom, to HD and Thermal we have exactly what you need, and our team can assist you with maximizing your network capabilities for remote viewing, recording and event management.

Fire Fighter Offers The Following Types of Electronic Safety Systems:






CARD ACCESS
Whether it be during business hours or after, it is crucial that no unauthorized personnel enter your facility to prevent any unwanted activity. Fire Fighter’s complete installation of a card access system will enhance your overall protection plan. While keys are easily lost or stolen and the changing of all locks and distribution of new keys would be inefficient and costly, card access has the capabilities to activate and deactivate cards when necessary as well as keep tabs on who is in and out of the office in the event of an emergency. Other benefits of card access systems are controlled entry into authorized areas, hard and soft anti-pass back, and input/output linking.
Whether you are in need of controlled access to proprietary information, document control, or medical records, Fire Fighter offers an extensive line of Access Control Systems to manage your facility. Our systems include biometric and HID Proximity Readers, Gate Control, Metal Detection, Photo ID Badge and Physical and Optical Turnstiles. Our professionals will guide you through the process from implementation, installation and training to ensure you have the right equipment for your specific needs. 








SURVEILLANCE
Each industry is faced with its own unique set of security issues. IP video systems and video management can be used to provide security for improved safety, as a deterrent for vandalism and loss prevention. 
Fire Fighter’s technology allows you to achieve greater security with high quality video and detail including facial recognition, the ability to discern license plates and thermal imaging for clearer images at night. Our experts have extensive knowledge and experience working with a variety of industries and will provide you with a customized security solution to minimize risk. 
Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company will provide system integration, service and maintenance to ensure your equipment is performing optimally. We offer a wide variety of network cameras to provide you with the best combination for your property.

STRUCTURED CABLING
Extensive cable networks are a large part of all business activity and communication, so it is crucial these are working properly. 
Our team at Fire Fighter will install a standard compliant structured cabling system to eliminate extensive down time and ensuring business processes and employee productivity are functioning at their best. 
Our professionals will perform a project assessment and have the knowledge to take care of your specific business needs.

ABOUT US











Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company has been the leading provider of trusted fire protection solutions since 1946. 
Our team of well-trained technicians are committed to excellence and satisfaction, in addition to protecting our clients from life-changing tragedies.  From our humble beginnings in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, we grew to open branches in Sharpsburg and Butler. 
Since 2010, our corporate headquarters has proudly called Warrendale, PA home, remaining a family-owned business. We have grown our fleet from three trucks to more than sixty service vehicles, serving industrial, commercial, institutional, government and residential customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Our large fleet of vehicles are fully equipped with recharging capabilities and full installation buildouts for all the fire prevention products and services we support. 
You can expect superior workmanship, competitive pricing and expert design from Fire Fighter. We know these components are key to creating long-term relationships with our customers. We have a passion for what we do and our commitment to our clientele is second to none, running 24/7/365.

“Your team did a great job and went above and beyond to help with my system!”
~Ryan, psychiatric facility
“Your tech is professional and friendly. He performs the technical functions, while also communicating in a way for us to understand.
It’s rare to possess both the technical and customer service skills which he displays during each visit.
He genuinely cares that the work gets done correctly and takes time to educate us. He is an excellent Fire Fighter representative and we appreciate all that he does for us.”
~Laura, moving company
“Your company has done an outstanding job for me over the years. The service people are your front line and they perform outstandingly.
But most important is the paperwork that must be maintained in the proper format and our account rep at Fire Fighter is on top of his game for this, he is timely and always open for a site visit to review.
As management myself, we are only as good as our team and you have a good team.”
~Dan, healthcare facility
“Your techs recently completed a fire alarm install, they are a great team and Fire Fighter is lucky to have them.”

~Karen, car dealership 
“Your staff was great to work with!”
~Brent, apartment complex
“The techs did a great job installing a new pre-piped kitchen hood system and were very professional.”

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING






“Your team did a great job and went above and beyond to help with my system!”
~Ryan, psychiatric facility








“Your tech is professional and friendly. He performs the technical functions, while also communicating in a way for us to understand.
It’s rare to possess both the technical and customer service skills which he displays during each visit.
He genuinely cares that the work gets done correctly and takes time to educate us. He is an excellent Fire Fighter representative and we appreciate all that he does for us.”
~Laura, moving company








“Your company has done an outstanding job for me over the years. The service people are your front line and they perform outstandingly.
But most important is the paperwork that must be maintained in the proper format and our account rep at Fire Fighter is on top of his game for this, he is timely and always open for a site visit to review.
As management myself, we are only as good as our team and you have a good team.”
~Dan, healthcare facility








“Your techs recently completed a fire alarm install, they are a great team and Fire Fighter is lucky to have them.”
~Sean, religious institution








“In all my years, I’ve never seen a crew of guys work as good and professionally as your team did. He couldn’t have been more impressed.”
