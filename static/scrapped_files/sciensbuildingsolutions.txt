Commercial office buildings possess a unique set of challenges—high floors, evacuation protocol, mass communication and access control to name a few. Different buildings have different solutions when it comes to safety and security, so we design custom systems that protect employees and property while enhancing operations and reducing costs. 
Sciens can help you identify risks, stay compliant with ever-changing code requirements and, most importantly, keep your people safe and secure.
