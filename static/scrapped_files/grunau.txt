I would like to compliment your guys who are working on the condensate line. They are very professional and continue to go the extra mile without me having to watch over them. Choosing Grunau is proving to be a great choice!!
- Michael Pabich, Manager Plant Operations at Aurora West Allis Medical Center
All of your employees are very friendly, professional and a pleasure to work with!
- Jim Karls, District Manager at Stericycle
The accuracy, timeliness and detail of the information you provide is extremely valuable to us, and we owe a large part of our success to you. The abilities and professionalism of your staff gives you tools that very few other organizations have the ability to draw upon.
- Mark Sherry, General Manager at Mortenson
Nuvo Construction Company, Inc. would like to offer sincere appreciation to the entire staff of the Grunau Company for their hard work, timeliness, and extension of services above and beyond what was required in recent projects.

Grunau Company and its employees have been an asset to the success of many of our projects, and will continue to be considered as a primary support in the future success of Nuvo Construction Company, Inc.
- Scott Farina, Project Manager at Nuvo Construction Company, Inc.
Your field forces were some of the most competent individuals I’ve ever seen. [They] went way beyond the normal effort required to make a complex mechanical project successful.
- Gene Hult, General Superintendent at Gilbane
We saw how nicely aligned the transition from copper to pex was oriented...this work was done by Grunau Company; a great example of people who care about their work!  This is standard for our team but it sure makes your Friday when you get to see the systems done properly, particularly when no one will ever see them again. Craft is alive and well!
- Matt Lutz, Founder at Flatwater Homes LLC
The experience and skill level of the Grunau team, combined with their concern for customer satisfaction and their respect for our budget, guarantees a job well done every time.
- Richard Nowakowski, Maintenance Supervisor for Housing at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)
All of your employees are very friendly, professional and a pleasure to work with!
- Jim Karls, District Manager at Stericycle
I cannot tell you how impressed we were with the commitment and service from each and every one of your staff. Due to your outstanding efforts, Milwaukee now has what is clearly a world-class facility.
-  Steven G. Chamberlin, President at CG Schmidt, Inc.
You put forth a superb effort to reach our goal. I would like to thank you for the energy and cooperation in maintaining the overall construction schedule.
- Bruce F. Danek, Project Manager at CG Schmidt, Inc.
Grunau Fire Protection should be recognized as part of the reason for the Marquette Interchange project's success.  The standpipe system they designed was easy to install and the fabrication work done in Grunau's pipe shop was excellent.  The Milwaukee Fire Department is extremely happy with this system.
- Dennis M. Maney, P.E., Marquette Core Project Manager at Edward Kraemer & Sons, Inc.
I wanted to express my appreciation for the flexibility that your crew showed during the equipment removal and placement for our Compound Management Services project at Sigma-Aldrich. Due to roof access constraints, the crew quickly shifted priorities and removed the exhaust fan before placing the make-up air unit, which was the reverse of their original plan. Your guys were well prepared, accommodating, and did a professional job and they should be commended as such.
- Gary Kok, Project Engineer at Sigma-Aldrich
I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for the expertise and experience that you have brought to the project. Your ability, and the abilities of your team members, has been instrumental in identifying many conflicts and issues for construction.
- Cindy Finstad, Project Manager at Mortenson
We have been battling some issues over the last few days with our penguin temps, and Randy (your technician) has been here for us to troubleshoot our system.  His dependability, patience and overall demeanor when he is here is the best.  I know he understands how stressful it is for us when the welfare of our animals is threatened, and his cool head and calm demeanor give us all confidence that any troubles will be resolved quickly and effectively.
- Alex Waier, Bird Curator at Milwaukee County Zoo
Grunau was involved in the construction of many of our buildings and their continued involvement in the day-to-day operations of the facility continues to benefit Miller. The relationship our companies have enjoyed over the years is a testimony to the trust factor we have established and the values we share. The personal involvement by Grunau's management ensures a very high level of customer satisfaction.
- Tom Blaedon, Corporate Facilities Manager at Miller Brewing Company
It is a real pleasure being in a business partnership with such a fine organization.
- Donald Anderson, Facility Manager at Accutec
Your integrity and ability as a respectable mechanical company has been exhibited thoroughly.  Nuvo Construction Company offers sincere appreciation to Grunau Company for their hard work, timeliness, and extension of services above and beyond what was required.
- Scott Farina, Project Manager at Nuvo Construction Company
I would like to extend a 'huge' thank you to the Grunau team for the effort that took place in fixing the water main break at our corporate headquarters. The team performed admirably and demonstrated your company's dedication to exceeding its customers' expectations. Please pass on my sincere thanks for a job well done.
- Ward Komorowski, Director, Facilities and Building Services at Johnson Controls, Inc.
Grunau is showing their leadership in and commitment to LEED by putting forward their own resources to dedicate the space they work in on a daily basis to LEED certification.
- John Gilroy, Project Executive at Gilbane
My thanks to you and your team on an outstanding effort in repairing the Veolia Water South Shore Interplant Sewer.  Grunau performed flawlessly in the safety arena; your team provided lean solutions when required as the project stalled and were professional start to finish.  And showing up very quickly when called as the leak was discovered won't be forgotten quickly.
- Don Kostrzewa, Maintenance Manager at Veolia Water North America
Grunau Company did an outstanding job. How many companies can get a contract award one day and be on site the very next day?
- Andy Blomstrom, Superintendent at JP Cullen & Sons, Inc.
I can honestly say that Grunau is the only contractor that I have ever worked with that truly has the customer's best interests at the forefront of all that they do.  I'm looking forward to a continued long-lasting successful partnership with Grunau.
- Steve Strzok, Facilities Services Manager at Metavante (now FIS)
I was amazed at the quality of work, cooperation, willingness to work together, and the professionalism of Grunau’s employees.
- David Hale, Project Engineer at HDR Architecture
When I take a look at this project after the fact, just from a safety, performance and value standpoint, Grunau did an excellent job. They exceeded my expectations. We had three contracts on this job and two of those contracts ended up costing less than what we originally expected. Grunau's people do a great job. Our whole team is looking forward to working with them again.
- Mark Lillesand, Senior Project Manager at CG Schmidt, Inc.
You should be proud of your staff for their exceptional service!
- Steven G. Chamberlin, Former President at CG Schmidt, Inc.
Thanks for working safely, with good housekeeping practices and just being customer focused.
- Don Kostrzewa, Maintenance Manager at Veolia Water N America
We are proud of the outcome and Grunau had a lot to do with its success!
- Richard J. Nierzwicki, Vice President of Operations at CG Schmidt, Inc.
The fire protection system at the Flint Hills Resources Milwaukee Terminal offered some unique challenges to Grunau, and they performed exceptionally at every turn.  The site restrictions and customer expectations could not have been any higher, and the Grunau personnel rose above the restrictions and led the effort to complete, commission, and train the Owner on a system that they were not familiar with.  Performance specifications can often prove difficult with subcontractors that are not familiar with a design-build firm, but Grunau provided excellent services and delivered on their promise.  It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with the good people at Grunau.
- Eric Kirchhofer, Project Manager at Burns & McDonnell
I wanted to express our thanks to Grunau's team for their help with the problems we are having with one of our surgery HVAC units. They located the parts and stayed late last night and again will this evening. They all really stepped up so we could continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. Thank you.
- Mike Connor, Director of Facility Operations at Aurora Health Care
Grunau Mechanical proved once again to be among the best and has been chosen as one of our top area subcontractors!
-  Steven G. Chamberlin, Former President at CG Schmidt, Inc.
I wanted to take the time to tell you how incredibly impressed I am with your employees.  In my 26 years of service, working with several contractors, I have come to the determination that NO ONE compares or offers the above and beyond service that Grunau provides.  While working at Metavante I was impressed with Grunau Company and once I took my position with Johnson Controls at Miller Park, it was apparent to me, I needed to bring Grunau on board.

Grunau is showing their leadership in and commitment to LEED by putting forward their own resources to dedicate the space they work in on a daily basis to LEED certification.- John Gilroy, Project Executive at Gilbane
My thanks to you and your team on an outstanding effort in repairing the Veolia Water South Shore Interplant Sewer.  Grunau performed flawlessly in the safety arena; your team provided lean solutions when required as the project stalled and were professional start to finish.  And showing up very quickly when called as the leak was discovered won't be forgotten quickly.- Don Kostrzewa, Maintenance Manager at Veolia Water North America
Grunau Company did an outstanding job. How many companies can get a contract award one day and be on site the very next day?- Andy Blomstrom, Superintendent at JP Cullen & Sons, Inc.
I can honestly say that Grunau is the only contractor that I have ever worked with that truly has the customer's best interests at the forefront of all that they do.  I'm looking forward to a continued long-lasting successful partnership with Grunau.- Steve Strzok, Facilities Services Manager at Metavante (now FIS)
I was amazed at the quality of work, cooperation, willingness to work together, and the professionalism of Grunau’s employees.- David Hale, Project Engineer at HDR Architecture
When I take a look at this project after the fact, just from a safety, performance and value standpoint, Grunau did an excellent job. They exceeded my expectations. We had three contracts on this job and two of those contracts ended up costing less than what we originally expected. Grunau's people do a great job. Our whole team is looking forward to working with them again.- Mark Lillesand, Senior Project Manager at CG Schmidt, Inc.
You should be proud of your staff for their exceptional service!- Steven G. Chamberlin, Former President at CG Schmidt, Inc.
Thanks for working safely, with good housekeeping practices and just being customer focused.- Don Kostrzewa, Maintenance Manager at Veolia Water N America
We are proud of the outcome and Grunau had a lot to do with its success!- Richard J. Nierzwicki, Vice President of Operations at CG Schmidt, Inc.
The fire protection system at the Flint Hills Resources Milwaukee Terminal offered some unique challenges to Grunau, and they performed exceptionally at every turn.  The site restrictions and customer expectations could not have been any higher, and the Grunau personnel rose above the restrictions and led the effort to complete, commission, and train the Owner on a system that they were not familiar with.  Performance specifications can often prove difficult with subcontractors that are not familiar with a design-build firm, but Grunau provided excellent services and delivered on their promise.  It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with the good people at Grunau.- Eric Kirchhofer, Project Manager at Burns & McDonnell
I wanted to express our thanks to Grunau's team for their help with the problems we are having with one of our surgery HVAC units. They located the parts and stayed late last night and again will this evening. They all really stepped up so we could continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers. Thank you.- Mike Connor, Director of Facility Operations at Aurora Health Care
Grunau Mechanical proved once again to be among the best and has been chosen as one of our top area subcontractors!-  Steven G. Chamberlin, Former President at CG Schmidt, Inc.
I wanted to take the time to tell you how incredibly impressed I am with your employees.  In my 26 years of service, working with several contractors, I have come to the determination that NO ONE compares or offers the above and beyond service that Grunau provides.  While working at Metavante I was impressed with Grunau Company and once I took my position with Johnson Controls at Miller Park, it was apparent to me, I needed to bring Grunau on board.- Luis V. Roche, Operations Supervisor/Miller Park at Johnson Controls, Inc.

Grunau Company’s pipe fitters install all types and sizes of pipe in a wide array of commercial, industrial, and institutional applications. We utilize our Pipe and Weld Shops to complete prefabrication for more efficient and cost-effective installation on job sites.

Our proven performance with process piping design and installation has taken us into breweries, food and pharmaceutical plants, and wastewater treatment plants, to name a few. We can repair your existing systems or create brand new ones. 

Contact us for all your process piping design and installation needs.

Lean Construction is not something extra we do; it is the way we conduct business every day. Lean is an integral part of our Grunau culture of continuous improvement.
"To continually examine our processes to provide greater value to our customers without waste."
Grunau has applied Lean Construction principles and tools to all facets of our operation, including job sites, office, trucks, and shops. Another system that Grunau has experience with is Integrated Project Delivery (IPD). IPD projects are becoming more popular as the construction industry understands that working together collaboratively maximizes value.

Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is a constantly improving approach to project delivery. Forward thinking owners, architects, and contractors like Grunau have long questioned the traditional processes of construction project delivery. Low-bid, plan/spec projects often create a climate where all parties try to protect their own interests in order to turn a profit. That climate has predictable consequences: decreased worker productivity, lengthened project schedules, and construction costs that are constantly on the rise.
On IPD projects, the individual’s success can only go as far as the entire team’s success; everyone succeeds (or fails) together. IPD projects are based on a foundation of collaboration, teamwork, and looking out for the best interest of the group. From the owner to the trade partners, everyone is a stakeholder in ensuring that the construction process is a success. Grunau’s core values align closely with the values of this process, and as such, we have been involved with successful IPD projects.
In many ways, the IPD approach is a reflection of Grunau’s own philosophy. We consider ourselves a resource to our customers instead of a mere commodity. IPD projects give Grunau the opportunity to do what we do best: bring value to our customers. We utilize tools like Pull Planning and Last Planner to achieve the customer’s goals. Grunau’s IPD track record is one of delivering a quality/usable product to our customer while coming in under our budgeted costs.
This track record, combined with our internal culture of continuous improvement, places Grunau at the forefront of prospective mechanical contractors on IPD projects.
Contact us when you are starting to plan a project using Integrated Project Delivery or lean construction methods to learn how we can be a valuable part of your team.

Contact us when you are starting to plan a project using Integrated Project Delivery or lean construction methods to learn how we can be a valuable part of your team.








On IPD projects, the individual’s success can only go as far as the entire team’s success; everyone succeeds (or fails) together. IPD projects are based on a foundation of collaboration, teamwork, and looking out for the best interest of the group. From the owner to the trade partners, everyone is a stakeholder in ensuring that the construction process is a success. Grunau’s core values align closely with the values of this process, and as such, we have been involved with successful IPD projects.
In many ways, the IPD approach is a reflection of Grunau’s own philosophy. We consider ourselves a resource to our customers instead of a mere commodity. IPD projects give Grunau the opportunity to do what we do best: bring value to our customers. We utilize tools like Pull Planning and Last Planner to achieve the customer’s goals. Grunau’s IPD track record is one of delivering a quality/usable product to our customer while coming in under our budgeted costs.
This track record, combined with our internal culture of continuous improvement, places Grunau at the forefront of prospective mechanical contractors on IPD projects.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an all-encompassing acronym that means different things to different people. At Grunau, we’ve been using CAD software since 1985 to help lay out ductwork sheet metal in our fabrication shop. As BIM technology improved, so did our use of newer software to integrate more aspects of our business. We are now using BIM to build a virtual model of the mechanical areas in a building and then use embedded information to assist in designing, constructing, and maintaining buildings. The level of detail often includes underground utilities, above ceiling work, in-wall work, all pipe sizes, pipe and duct joints, all valves, drains and vents, insulation, hangers, code required and/or maintenance clearance zones. This Building Information Modeling technology revolves around cost and risk reductions to provide better value to our customers.

Some of the BIM tools we’ve used on various projects include:

Grunau upgraded the heating and ventilation system at this Madison VA hospital. To avoid jeopardizing current research projects at this medical facility, Grunau was given a 24-hour window to shut down the old and start the new equipment.  With coordination, preplanning, and innovative thinking, Grunau completed the final tie-ins and exchange within 10 hours.
