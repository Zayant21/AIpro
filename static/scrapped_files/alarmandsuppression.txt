The new location, just off Northway Exit-10, provides A&S with much needed expanded office and stock/warehouse area. Frank Clair, A&S CEO, stated that “with the recent growth of the business and addition of staff over the past year we just need more space. We now have everyone on one floor and all our material in one location, which allows us to perform at a much more efficient level.

				Alarm & Suppression Has Moved!			




The new location, just off Northway Exit-10, provides A&S with much needed expanded office and stock/warehouse area. Frank Clair, A&S CEO, stated that “with the recent growth of the business and addition of staff over the past year we just need more space. We now have everyone on one floor and all our material in one location, which allows us to perform at a much more efficient level. The Exit-10 location is also convenient for our staff and customers”. Please contact Alarm & Suppression for more information or to schedule a visit to our new location.
