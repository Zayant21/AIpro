More
Current regulatory codes require a recurring schedule of test and inspection on all types of fire protection systems. Let us help you navigate the applicable code sections for your industry to ensure compliance.

More Than Just Fire Protection,We're Your Peace of Mind.
Proudly serving New England with offices in Connecticut,
Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.
Testing and Inspection
Any fire protection system is only as good as your last inspection.
24-Hour Service
Sometimes service, maintenance and emergencies
don't recognize a nine-to-five workday.
Bi-Directional Amplifiers
Get your building into compliance with
Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC).
The right alarm system can save lives and protect your business against devastating loss.  You need us to make sure you have the right fire alarm system for your business and that it is properly installed and maintained, so it will be ready when you need it.
More
Sprinklers reduce the direct cost of property damage by 68% when properly installed and maintained.  We verify whether your building is properly equipped and ensure your system is in working order, so that it will be effective when you need it most.
More
Encore uses the latest fire suppression technologies from leading brands like Kidde, Ansul, and Amerex, to provide cutting edge clean agent, CO2, dry and wet-chemical solutions for all special hazards.
More
It is not enough to just have the right type of extinguisher for your building.  Your extinguishers need to be regularly tested and your people properly trained in order for them to be effective during an emergency.  We can help.
More
Current regulatory codes require a recurring schedule of test and inspection on all types of fire protection systems. Let us help you navigate the applicable code sections for your industry to ensure compliance.
More
From high rises to data centers, commercial kitchens to cultural centers and educational campuses. Encore provides customized fire protection solutions across a wide range of industries and facilities.
More
What are you trying to protect?
Regular test and inspection of all of your fire protection equipment is the only way to ensure your systems are in compliance with local regulations and will work when you need them.
Why do we do what we do?  To help save lives and protect property. Our service team is ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, so that we are there when you need us.
Whether you are looking to outfit a new or existing building, Encore will design and install fire alarm, fire sprinkler, and fire suppression systems for buildings of any occupancy, large or small.
 Just submit your details and we’ll be in touch shortly. You can also email us if you would prefer or call 1-800-966-0000. Our offices are open Monday – Friday from 8:00 – 5:00 EST but we are standing by 24 hours a day, 7-days a week to help with emergencies.

From maintaining a job schedule that’s within budget to providing 24 hour emergency service, Encore does it right from the beginning and the results are satisfied customers throughout the Northeast.

Home Fire Alarms
Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.
According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.
Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.
From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements. Encore is a licensed distributor of top brands in fire protection, including Gamewell-FCI. Encore also provides fire alarm solutions from any manufacturer you choose ensuring you get the right technology to protect your assets.
Each product and service offered by Encore is compliant with the following:
*Information updated as of October 2016. Frequencies can vary based on system components and direction from the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). Contact your AHJ or Encore Fire Protection to get the most up to date information for your facility.  
If a fire alarm goes off in the night, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?  Our sales and service teams’ are standing by to answer this and other frequently asked questions about the proper use of fire alarms in your building.
We strive to deliver an unparalleled service experience for every customer, on every project. We want to be the singular provider for all your fire protection needs, and we want you to call us back for an encore.

Fire Alarms: Monitor, Detect & Protect
Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.
According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.
Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.
Types of Systems
From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements. Encore is a licensed distributor of top brands in fire protection, including Gamewell-FCI. Encore also provides fire alarm solutions from any manufacturer you choose ensuring you get the right technology to protect your assets.

Conventional Systems – A standard offering in the fire protection industry, this type of system offers individually-wired panels, perfect for smaller rooms or facilities.
Addressable Systems – For larger buildings or multi-site facilities, Addressable Systems connect alarm devices through a shared panel, notifying and directing you to the triggered device(s).
Monitoring – Detects a triggered fire alarm and electronically notifies authorities about smoke, fire, and other events.conventional-panels
Networked Systems – Distributes information about smoke, fire, and other events to multiple alarm panels, especially in larger facilities.
Voice Evacuation – Adds an additional layer of protection by broadcasting voice commands throughout a facility, in addition to the alarm, in the case of a fire emergency.
Mass Notification Systems – Delivers audible, visual, or text notifications to a large number of people in the event of an emergency situation of any kind.
Other Systems Offered – Spot smoke, air sampling (VESDA), beam detection, duct detection, video smoke detection, spot heat detection, linear heat detection, flame detection, gas detection, leak detection, masterboxes, digital communicators, and dialers.

Regulations and Compliance
Each product and service offered by Encore is compliant with the following:

Regulation: NFPA 72, the National Fire Alarm & Signaling Code Standard
Specifies “the application, installation, location, performance, inspection, testing, and maintenance of fire alarm systems, fire warning equipment and emergency warning equipment, and their components.”
Connecticut (NFPA 72 2010 Edition) – Quarterly*
Massachusetts (NFPA 72 2010 Edition) – Annually*
New Hampshire (NFPA 72 2010 Edition) Quarterly*
Rhode Island (NFPA 72 2010 Edition) – Quarterly*

*Information updated as of October 2016. Frequencies can vary based on system components and direction from the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). Contact your AHJ or Encore Fire Protection to get the most up to date information for your facility.

Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.
According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.
Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.
Types of Systems
From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements.

Monitoring – Detects a triggered fire alarm and electronically notifies authorities about smoke, fire, and other events.conventional-panels
Networked Systems – Distributes information about smoke, fire, and other events to multiple alarm panels, especially in larger facilities.
Voice Evacuation – Adds an additional layer of protection by broadcasting voice commands throughout a facility, in addition to the alarm, in the case of a fire emergency.

Fire Alarms: Monitor, Detect & Protect
Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.
According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.
Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.
Types of Systems
From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements. Encore is a licensed distributor of top brands in fire protection, including Gamewell-FCI. Encore also provides fire alarm solutions from any manufacturer you choose ensuring you get the right technology to protect your assets.

Conventional Systems – A standard offering in the fire protection industry, this type of system offers individually-wired panels, perfect for smaller rooms or facilities.
Addressable Systems – For larger buildings or multi-site facilities, Addressable Systems connect alarm devices through a shared panel, notifying and directing you to the triggered device(s).
Monitoring – Detects a triggered fire alarm and electronically notifies authorities about smoke, fire, and other events.conventional-panels
Networked Systems – Distributes information about smoke, fire, and other events to multiple alarm panels, especially in larger facilities.
Voice Evacuation – Adds an additional layer of protection by broadcasting voice commands throughout a facility, in addition to the alarm, in the case of a fire emergency.
Mass Notification Systems – Delivers audible, visual, or text notifications to a large number of people in the event of an emergency situation of any kind.
Other Systems Offered – Spot smoke, air sampling (VESDA), beam detection, duct detection, video smoke detection, spot heat detection, linear heat detection, flame detection, gas detection, leak detection, masterboxes, digital communicators, and dialers.

We align incentives so you'll know we're in it together
With more than 30-years experience, Encore is one of the oldest and most experienced fire protection companies in New England. Our team is equipped to design and install your buildings’ fire sprinkler system or provide test and inspection services for the system already in place.
Considered the most reliable fire protection system available, fire sprinklers are made up of a network of piping which carry pressurized water that discharges through sprinkler heads when the effects of a fire have been detected. According to NFPA, the vast majority of fires are contained with just 1 to 2 sprinkler heads activating.
Properly installed and maintained fire sprinklers are effective over 96% of the time and prevent widespread damage to your facility. Unfortunately, as recently as 2011, the National Fire Protection Association reported that only 10% of structural fires had properly maintained sprinklers present which lead to many cases of needless property damage and even injury and loss of life. Ensuring your facility’s fire sprinkler system is up to current codes and properly maintained is critical to mitigating the significant liability that fire conditions present every day.
Encore is the expert in the design and installation of all makes and models of fire sprinkler equipment. Our team of trained technicians can keep you in compliance through our testing and inspection services, and are available for 24/7 emergency service to keep your business up and running. We are licensed distributors of some of the leading fire sprinkler manufacturers, including Tyco, Ferguson, Reliable, Victaulic, and Viking, and can design a system that is right for your facility.
Our team is OSHA trained, licensed, and certified to install and service systems in all six New England states. Each product and service offered by Encore is also compliant with the following:
Regulation:
If you have question our team of industry experts can give you answers and help to identify the fire protection services that are right for you and your company:
We strive to deliver an unparalleled service experience for every customer, on every project. We want to be the singular provider for all your fire protection needs, and we want you to call us back for an encore.

Wet Systems – The simplest, most common method of fire sprinkler systems, wet systems consist of pipes that contain pressurized water that is deployed when fire or high temperatures are detected.
Dry Systems – Pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, rather than water and are often used where system piping will be exposed to freezing temperatures. This air holds a remote valve in a closed position. The remote valve prevents water from entering the pipe until a fire causes a sprinkler head to activate releasing the air, opening the remote valve and delivering water to the activated sprinkler
Fire Pumps – Fire pumps, usually powered by an electric, or diesel source, and drawing water from a public or private water supply, are used properly feed a sprinkler system when water pressure is not adequate.
Sprinkler Heads – A key component to ensure effective heat detection and the release of water once a fire has been detected, it is important to ensure all sprinkler heads remain functional and compliant.
Standpipes – This series of pipes connect to fire hose stations located throughout a building, allowing fire firefighters to access the water supply in the event of an emergency.
Deluge Systems – Used in highly hazardous areas such power plants and processing facilities, deluge systems deploy water with a rapid, heavy response to extinguish fires.
Pre-Action System – A two-step system that first identifies smoke, fire, or heat, pre-action systems then activate a pre-action valve that releases water flow onto the affected area. This two-step system is used in sensitive areas where water damage could be costly.
Encore also offers: Jockey pumps, fire hydrants, foam systems, and backflow preventers.

Unfortunately, as recently as 2011, the National Fire Protection Association reported that only 10% of structural fires had properly maintained sprinklers present which lead to many cases of needless property damage and even injury and loss of life. Ensuring your facility’s fire sprinkler system is up to current codes and properly maintained is critical to mitigating the significant liability that fire conditions present every day.
Types of Fire Sprinkler Systems and Components
Encore is the expert in the design and installation of all makes and models of fire sprinkler equipment. Our team of trained technicians can keep you in compliance through our testing and inspection services, and are available for 24/7 emergency service to keep your business up and running. We are licensed distributors of some of the leading fire sprinkler manufacturers, including Tyco, Ferguson, Reliable, Victaulic, and Viking, and can design a system that is right for your facility.

Wet Systems – The simplest, most common method of fire sprinkler systems, wet systems consist of pipes that contain pressurized water that is deployed when fire or high temperatures are detected.
Dry Systems – Pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, rather than water and are often used where system piping will be exposed to freezing temperatures. This air holds a remote valve in a closed position. The remote valve prevents water from entering the pipe until a fire causes a sprinkler head to activate releasing the air, opening the remote valve and delivering water to the activated sprinkler
Fire Pumps – Fire pumps, usually powered by an electric, or diesel source, and drawing water from a public or private water supply, are used properly feed a sprinkler system when water pressure is not adequate.
Sprinkler Heads – A key component to ensure effective heat detection and the release of water once a fire has been detected, it is important to ensure all sprinkler heads remain functional and compliant.
Standpipes – This series of pipes connect to fire hose stations located throughout a building, allowing fire firefighters to access the water supply in the event of an emergency.
Deluge Systems – Used in highly hazardous areas such power plants and processing facilities, deluge systems deploy water with a rapid, heavy response to extinguish fires.
Pre-Action System – A two-step system that first identifies smoke, fire, or heat, pre-action systems then activate a pre-action valve that releases water flow onto the affected area. This two-step system is used in sensitive areas where water damage could be costly.
Encore also offers: Jockey pumps, fire hydrants, foam systems, and backflow preventers.

Regulations and Compliance
Our team is OSHA trained, licensed, and certified to install and service systems in all six New England states. Each product and service offered by Encore is also compliant with the following:
Regulation:

NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems 
NFPA 20: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection
NFPA 25, the Standard for the Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems*

Standpipes – This series of pipes connect to fire hose stations located throughout a building, allowing fire firefighters to access the water supply in the event of an emergency.
Deluge Systems – Used in highly hazardous areas such power plants and processing facilities, deluge systems deploy water with a rapid, heavy response to extinguish fires.
Pre-Action System – A two-step system that first identifies smoke, fire, or heat, pre-action systems then activate a pre-action valve that releases water flow onto the affected area. This two-step system is used in sensitive areas where water damage could be costly.
Encore also offers: Jockey pumps, fire hydrants, foam systems, and backflow preventers.

Fire Sprinklers: Ensure Quality and Safety
With more than 30-years experience, Encore is one of the oldest and most experienced fire protection companies in New England. Our team is equipped to design and install your buildings’ fire sprinkler system or provide test and inspection services for the system already in place.
Considered the most reliable fire protection system available, fire sprinklers are made up of a network of piping which carry pressurized water that discharges through sprinkler heads when the effects of a fire have been detected. According to NFPA, the vast majority of fires are contained with just 1 to 2 sprinkler heads activating.
Properly installed and maintained fire sprinklers are effective over 96% of the time and prevent widespread damage to your facility. Unfortunately, as recently as 2011, the National Fire Protection Association reported that only 10% of structural fires had properly maintained sprinklers present which lead to many cases of needless property damage and even injury and loss of life. Ensuring your facility’s fire sprinkler system is up to current codes and properly maintained is critical to mitigating the significant liability that fire conditions present every day.
Types of Fire Sprinkler Systems and Components
Encore is the expert in the design and installation of all makes and models of fire sprinkler equipment. Our team of trained technicians can keep you in compliance through our testing and inspection services, and are available for 24/7 emergency service to keep your business up and running. We are licensed distributors of some of the leading fire sprinkler manufacturers, including Tyco, Ferguson, Reliable, Victaulic, and Viking, and can design a system that is right for your facility.

Wet Systems – The simplest, most common method of fire sprinkler systems, wet systems consist of pipes that contain pressurized water that is deployed when fire or high temperatures are detected.
Dry Systems – Pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, rather than water and are often used where system piping will be exposed to freezing temperatures. This air holds a remote valve in a closed position. The remote valve prevents water from entering the pipe until a fire causes a sprinkler head to activate releasing the air, opening the remote valve and delivering water to the activated sprinkler
Fire Pumps – Fire pumps, usually powered by an electric, or diesel source, and drawing water from a public or private water supply, are used properly feed a sprinkler system when water pressure is not adequate.
Sprinkler Heads – A key component to ensure effective heat detection and the release of water once a fire has been detected, it is important to ensure all sprinkler heads remain functional and compliant.

Home Fire Suppression
Fire Suppression Systems offer a wide range of response to extinguishing fires in the most challenging hazard areas where a traditional water system would cause too much damage or down time.
When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.
New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.
Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.

Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.
Additional Resources for Kitchen Fire Suppression Systems:

Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the
pump and in the garage.explosion each year. Many fires start in vehicle engines, or by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, arcing and use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at vehicles, at the pumps, or in the garage, keeping your employees and customers safe. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.
Featured Products:
Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored.  These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.
In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.
If you are still unclear on the best suppression system for your facility, or whether a traditional extinguishing system may be sufficient, then you should call our team of suppression experts to discuss the full range of options that exist.
We strive to deliver an unparalleled service experience for every customer, on every project. We want to be the singular provider for all your fire protection needs, and we want you to call us back for an encore

Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of naturally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid – A sustainable fire protection fluid and HFC alternative that works quickly, cleanly, and efficiently to help stop a fire before it starts.
Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.
Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.
Encore also offers: Deluge, Pre-Action, and Water Mist Systems

Fire Suppression: Meeting Unique Safety Challenges
Fire Suppression Systems offer a wide range of response to extinguishing fires in the most challenging hazard areas where a traditional water system would cause too much damage or down time.
When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.
New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.
Types of Systems
Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.

Clean Agent Systems


Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of naturally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid – A sustainable fire protection fluid and HFC alternative that works quickly, cleanly, and efficiently to help stop a fire before it starts.
Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.

Liquid/Foam-Based Systems

Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.
Encore also offers: Deluge, Pre-Action, and Water Mist Systems

Kitchen Systems
Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.

 Gas & Service Station Systems

Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the
pump and in the garage.explosion each year. Many fires start in vehicle engines, or by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, arcing and use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at vehicles, at the pumps, or in the garage, keeping your employees and customers safe. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.
Featured Products:

Pyrochem Attendant I & II Gas Station Fire Protection Systems
PyroChem Monarch

Industrial Dry Chemical
Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored.  These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.
In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.





Frequently Asked Questions
If you are still unclear on the best suppression system for your facility, or whether a traditional extinguishing system may be sufficient, then you should call our team of suppression experts to discuss the full range of options that exist.

What are the benefits of a clean agent system vs. a traditional foam based system?
How frequently should a commercial kitchen hood be cleaned?
What are the differences between the Pyrochem Attendant I vs. II?

Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.

Clean Agent Systems


Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of naturally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid – A sustainable fire protection fluid and HFC alternative that works quickly, cleanly, and efficiently to help stop a fire before it starts.
Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.

Liquid/Foam-Based Systems

Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.
Encore also offers: Deluge, Pre-Action, and Water Mist Systems

Kitchen Systems
Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.

 Gas & Service Station Systems

Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the
pump and in the garage.explosion each year. Many fires start in vehicle engines, or by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, arcing and use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at vehicles, at the pumps, or in the garage, keeping your employees and customers safe. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Industrial Dry Chemical
Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored.  These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.
In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.





Frequently Asked Questions
If you are still unclear on the best suppression system for your facility, or whether a traditional extinguishing system may be sufficient, then you should call our team of suppression experts to discuss the full range of options that exist.

What are the benefits of a clean agent system vs. a traditional foam based system?

Fire Suppression: Meeting Unique Safety Challenges
Fire Suppression Systems offer a wide range of response to extinguishing fires in the most challenging hazard areas where a traditional water system would cause too much damage or down time.
When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.
New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.

When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.
New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.
Types of Systems
Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.

Clean Agent Systems


Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of naturally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
3M™ Novec™ 1230 Fire Protection Fluid – A sustainable fire protection fluid and HFC alternative that works quickly, cleanly, and efficiently to help stop a fire before it starts.
Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.

Liquid/Foam-Based Systems

Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.
Encore also offers: Deluge, Pre-Action, and Water Mist Systems

Kitchen Systems
Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.

 Gas & Service Station Systems

Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the
pump and in the garage.explosion each year. Many fires start in vehicle engines, or by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, arcing and use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at vehicles, at the pumps, or in the garage, keeping your employees and customers safe. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.
Featured Products:

Pyrochem Attendant I & II Gas Station Fire Protection Systems
PyroChem Monarch

Industrial Dry Chemical
Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored.  These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.
In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.

Home Fire Extinguishers
Fire extinguishers are the first line of defense in the event of a fire, largely due to their accessibility and portability in any space. Per NFPA, your fire extinguishers are required to be inspected monthly and maintained annually, keeping your facility safe and compliant. Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.
Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
Encore sells, installs, services, tests, and inspects all makes and models of fire extinguishers in accordance with NFPA 10.
 
 
If you own or operate your own business, you need fire extinguishers. But you don’t have to be an expert on them. Call our service team today today to get answers to these common questions and to have your building set up with a recurring test and inspection schedule:

Class A — Used for paper, wood, cloth, or other common trash fires
Class B — Used for fires caused by petroleum, gasoline, oil, paint, propane and butane
Class C — Used for fires caused by active electrical devices, fuse boxes, wiring, computers, and electrical sources
Class K — Used for kitchen-based fires, which account for nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year
Dry Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a dry chemical to smother and insulate combustible materials. The most common type of fire extinguisher, multipurpose ABC, fall into this category.
Wet Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a liquid saponifying agent to create a chemical reaction that suffocates grease fires. Commonly referred to as Class K, these units are supplemental to kitchen fire suppression systems as required by NFPA 17A (Standard for Wet Chemical Extinguishing Systems).
Clean Agent Hand Portables — These units use a gaseous agent to deplete oxygen around a fire, and are intended to leave minimal residue, thus extinguishing the fire and limiting damage to expensive equipment that ordinary liquid or powder extinguishers may cause.
Stored-Pressure Water Hand Portables — Ideal for Class A fires involving common combustibles, this model allows for easy, cost-effective recharging.
Wheeled Portable Extinguishing Units — These units are for larger hazards, usually used in commercial facilities with el5mb_6h20_lgevated hazards. They are equipped with a long hose and are mounted on a wheeled cart to allow for easy transportation of extinguishing agent quantities. These units can contain any type of extinguishing agent, Dry Chemical, Wet Chemical, Clean Agent and Foam.

Fire Extinguishers: Simple Safety
Fire extinguishers are the first line of defense in the event of a fire, largely due to their accessibility and portability in any space. Per NFPA, your fire extinguishers are required to be inspected monthly and maintained annually, keeping your facility safe and compliant. Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.
Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
Fire Extinguisher Ratings

Class A — Used for paper, wood, cloth, or other common trash fires
Class B — Used for fires caused by petroleum, gasoline, oil, paint, propane and butane

Class K — Used for kitchen-based fires, which account for nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year

Encore sells, installs, services, tests, and inspects all makes and models of fire extinguishers in accordance with NFPA 10.

Fire Extinguishers: Simple Safety
Fire extinguishers are the first line of defense in the event of a fire, largely due to their accessibility and portability in any space. Per NFPA, your fire extinguishers are required to be inspected monthly and maintained annually, keeping your facility safe and compliant. Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.
Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
Fire Extinguisher Ratings

Class A — Used for paper, wood, cloth, or other common trash fires
Class B — Used for fires caused by petroleum, gasoline, oil, paint, propane and butane
Class C — Used for fires caused by active electrical devices, fuse boxes, wiring, computers, and electrical sources
Class K — Used for kitchen-based fires, which account for nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year


Types of Extinguishers
Encore sells, installs, services, tests, and inspects all makes and models of fire extinguishers in accordance with NFPA 10.

Dry Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a dry chemical to smother and insulate combustible materials. The most common type of fire extinguisher, multipurpose ABC, fall into this category.
Wet Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a liquid saponifying agent to create a chemical reaction that suffocates grease fires. Commonly referred to as Class K, these units are supplemental to kitchen fire suppression systems as required by NFPA 17A (Standard for Wet Chemical Extinguishing Systems).
Clean Agent Hand Portables — These units use a gaseous agent to deplete oxygen around a fire, and are intended to leave minimal residue, thus extinguishing the fire and limiting damage to expensive equipment that ordinary liquid or powder extinguishers may cause.
Stored-Pressure Water Hand Portables — Ideal for Class A fires involving common combustibles, this model allows for easy, cost-effective recharging.
Wheeled Portable Extinguishing Units — These units are for larger hazards, usually used in commercial facilities with el5mb_6h20_lgevated hazards. They are equipped with a long hose and are mounted on a wheeled cart to allow for easy transportation of extinguishing agent quantities. These units can contain any type of extinguishing agent, Dry Chemical, Wet Chemical, Clean Agent and Foam.

Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.
Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
Fire Extinguisher Ratings

Class A — Used for paper, wood, cloth, or other common trash fires
Class B — Used for fires caused by petroleum, gasoline, oil, paint, propane and butane
Class C — Used for fires caused by active electrical devices, fuse boxes, wiring, computers, and electrical sources
Class K — Used for kitchen-based fires, which account for nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year


Types of Extinguishers
Encore sells, installs, services, tests, and inspects all makes and models of fire extinguishers in accordance with NFPA 10.

Dry Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a dry chemical to smother and insulate combustible materials. The most common type of fire extinguisher, multipurpose ABC, fall into this category.
Wet Chemical Hand Portables — These units use a liquid saponifying agent to create a chemical reaction that suffocates grease fires. Commonly referred to as Class K, these units are supplemental to kitchen fire suppression systems as required by NFPA 17A (Standard for Wet Chemical Extinguishing Systems).
Clean Agent Hand Portables — These units use a gaseous agent to deplete oxygen around a fire, and are intended to leave minimal residue, thus extinguishing the fire and limiting damage to expensive equipment that ordinary liquid or powder extinguishers may cause.
Stored-Pressure Water Hand Portables — Ideal for Class A fires involving common combustibles, this model allows for easy, cost-effective recharging.
Wheeled Portable Extinguishing Units — These units are for larger hazards, usually used in commercial facilities with el5mb_6h20_lgevated hazards. They are equipped with a long hose and are mounted on a wheeled cart to allow for easy transportation of extinguishing agent quantities. These units can contain any type of extinguishing agent, Dry Chemical, Wet Chemical, Clean Agent and Foam.

Encore Fire Protection can design, install, service, test, and inspect fire safety systems for a wide variety of industries and buildings, including: Construction, Cultural & Historical Institutions, Education, Property & Facility Management, Gas & Service Stations, Industrial & General Manufacturing, IT & Data Centers, Medical & Healthcare, and Restaurants & Hospitality.

As a facility manager, your primary focus is to mitigate liability and ensure the safety and security of your tenants, employees, and visitors. Yet, with robust systems in place, maintaining such complex systems can often be a burden on property managers who are forced to balance tight budgets with maintaining compliance. From high-rise buildings to office parks, shopping centers to stand-alone storefronts, apartment buildings to hotels, Encore can design and install the appropriate fire alarm and suppression systems to meet building and fire code requirements. New technologies, including intelligent fire alarm systems that incorporate early detection, mass notification, and early communications, can expedite response to potential hazards. Encore can also implement testing and inspection programs that bring your systems and equipment, including fire extinguishers, into full compliance and guarantee full-functionality should an emergency arise.

Within the world of education, from nurseries and daycare facilities to elementary and secondary schools to colleges and universities, students, faculty, and administrators face many safety threats each day. In addition to fire hazards, they are vulnerable to intruders and violence that can result in injury, casualty, and property damage. Though current NFPA standards for education are already strict, changes to NFPA codes in 2018 will include substantial updates  to campus security and fire safety requirements. Encore can work with facility managers in education to design, install, test, inspect and maintain the appropriate technology for any educational property, including integrated systems that unify fire detection and suppression, mass notification, and emergency communications at one facility or across a campus.

Healthcare facility managers are not only responsible for the care and wellness of patients, but also the safety and service of sophisticated medical equipment, laboratories, and data and EMR systems. Gas and oxygen cylinders, fire exit obstructions, and even kitchens are all hazards that can spark a potential catastrophe at any medical or healthcare facility. Compliance with the stringent NFPA and JCAHO standards are essential to licensure, certification, and accreditation. Encore’s technical specialists can design, install, test, inspect, and service fire safety systems for a variety of facilities, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, MRI and medical imaging facilities, clinical laboratories, and nursing homes, and ensure that your patients, staff, and equipment are properly protected, and that your facility is compliant with the appropriate standards.

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

Preserving and protecting cultural and historical artifacts is critical for museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Paintings, statues, documents, and other collections are one of a kind and irreplaceable. And, what’s more is that the structures housing these fragile rarities are also historically significant and cannot afford to be damaged by fire.  Encore offers a variety fire suppression systems with integrated fire detection and alarms that provide command and control benefits that minimize fire and water damage to collections and property and are minimally obtrusive to the architectural detail of the structure.

Commercial kitchens are among the highest risk for fire. Nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year. Fifty-seven percent of all restaurant fires involve cooking equipment, causing nearly a quarter billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime. Restaurant fire suppression systems are your first line of defense against fire and damage in the kitchen. Encore customizes fire suppression systems and fire extinguishers for a wide range of commercial food service facilities, be it a food truck or banquet facility, to keep your kitchen up and running. Encore also provides ongoing testing and inspection services to ensure that your restaurant is code compliant at all times.

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Construction sites of all sizes and types face a wide range of fire hazards, and like the wide range of hazards, the list of compliance codes and standards are far-reaching and extensive. In addition to NFPA, OSHA mandates specific requirements for implementing fire protection and training programs which focus on fire prevention and preparation for employees and contractors on a site. Encore works with construction companies, contractors, and building engineers to develop and deploy comprehensive fire safety systems, including training and installation of fixed and mobile fire suppression systems, to keep construction sites compliant.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

6 Core Strategies to Achieve Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities


Industrial & General Manufacturing

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT & Data Centers

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Customized Solutions for Your Industry
Encore Fire Protection can design, install, service, test, and inspect fire safety systems for a wide variety of industries and buildings, including: Construction, Cultural & Historical Institutions, Education, Property & Facility Management, Gas & Service Stations, Industrial & General Manufacturing, IT & Data Centers, Medical & Healthcare, and Restaurants & Hospitality.

Property & Facility Management

As a facility manager, your primary focus is to mitigate liability and ensure the safety and security of your tenants, employees, and visitors. Yet, with robust systems in place, maintaining such complex systems can often be a burden on property managers who are forced to balance tight budgets with maintaining compliance. From high-rise buildings to office parks, shopping centers to stand-alone storefronts, apartment buildings to hotels, Encore can design and install the appropriate fire alarm and suppression systems to meet building and fire code requirements. New technologies, including intelligent fire alarm systems that incorporate early detection, mass notification, and early communications, can expedite response to potential hazards. Encore can also implement testing and inspection programs that bring your systems and equipment, including fire extinguishers, into full compliance and guarantee full-functionality should an emergency arise.

Healthcare facility managers are not only responsible for the care and wellness of patients, but also the safety and service of sophisticated medical equipment, laboratories, and data and EMR systems. Gas and oxygen cylinders, fire exit obstructions, and even kitchens are all hazards that can spark a potential catastrophe at any medical or healthcare facility. Compliance with the stringent NFPA and JCAHO standards are essential to licensure, certification, and accreditation. Encore’s technical specialists can design, install, test, inspect, and service fire safety systems for a variety of facilities, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, MRI and medical imaging facilities, clinical laboratories, and nursing homes, and ensure that your patients, staff, and equipment are properly protected, and that your facility is compliant with the appropriate standards.

6 Core Strategies to Achieve Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities


Industrial & General Manufacturing

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT & Data Centers

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

Commercial kitchens are among the highest risk for fire. Nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year. Fifty-seven percent of all restaurant fires involve cooking equipment, causing nearly a quarter billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime. Restaurant fire suppression systems are your first line of defense against fire and damage in the kitchen. Encore customizes fire suppression systems and fire extinguishers for a wide range of commercial food service facilities, be it a food truck or banquet facility, to keep your kitchen up and running. Encore also provides ongoing testing and inspection services to ensure that your restaurant is code compliant at all times.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Commercial kitchens are among the highest risk for fire. Nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year. Fifty-seven percent of all restaurant fires involve cooking equipment, causing nearly a quarter billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime. Restaurant fire suppression systems are your first line of defense against fire and damage in the kitchen. Encore customizes fire suppression systems and fire extinguishers for a wide range of commercial food service facilities, be it a food truck or banquet facility, to keep your kitchen up and running. Encore also provides ongoing testing and inspection services to ensure that your restaurant is code compliant at all times.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

6 Core Strategies to Achieve Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities


Industrial & General Manufacturing

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT & Data Centers

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

6 Core Strategies to Achieve Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities


Industrial & General Manufacturing

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT & Data Centers

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.

Medical & Healthcare

Healthcare facility managers are not only responsible for the care and wellness of patients, but also the safety and service of sophisticated medical equipment, laboratories, and data and EMR systems. Gas and oxygen cylinders, fire exit obstructions, and even kitchens are all hazards that can spark a potential catastrophe at any medical or healthcare facility. Compliance with the stringent NFPA and JCAHO standards are essential to licensure, certification, and accreditation. Encore’s technical specialists can design, install, test, inspect, and service fire safety systems for a variety of facilities, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, MRI and medical imaging facilities, clinical laboratories, and nursing homes, and ensure that your patients, staff, and equipment are properly protected, and that your facility is compliant with the appropriate standards.

6 Core Strategies to Achieve Fire Safety in Healthcare Facilities


Industrial & General Manufacturing

Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.

IT & Data Centers

IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.

Commercial kitchens are among the highest risk for fire. Nearly 8,000 eating and drinking establishments report a fire in the kitchen each year. Fifty-seven percent of all restaurant fires involve cooking equipment, causing nearly a quarter billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime. Restaurant fire suppression systems are your first line of defense against fire and damage in the kitchen. Encore customizes fire suppression systems and fire extinguishers for a wide range of commercial food service facilities, be it a food truck or banquet facility, to keep your kitchen up and running.

Gas & Service Stations

On average, one in every 13 service stations will experience a fire or explosion annually, causing millions of dollars of direct property damage and costly station downtime. Many fires start in the engines of vehicles and by the ignition of flammable liquids and gases, electrical failures, use of welders in the garage, and general negligence (improperly discharged sparks, cigarette smoking at the pump). Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the pump and in the garage. Encore uses UL1254-compliant fuel island suppression systems, customized dry chemical solutions for garage and paint booths, and fire extinguishers throughout the site.
