Fire Alarms: Monitor, Detect & Protect
Encore designs, installs, tests, inspects, and services fire alarm systems for all types of commercial properties throughout New England.
According to the U.S. Fire Administration, an estimated 99,500 nonresidential building fires were reported to authorities in the U.S. in 2014 alone, causing death, injury, and $2.6 billion dollars in losses. A large amount of these fires were the result of human error in construction, wiring, or electronic use. A great deal of the injury, loss of life, and incurred damage could have been prevented with properly installed and maintained fire alarm systems.
Fire alarm and detection systems monitor and detect smoke, fire, and other hazards in your facility and quickly notify the necessary parties to move to action. As a foundational component of fire protection, the importance of an up-to-date, code compliant system cannot be understated. As a tried-and-true solution, all commercial properties and facilities across a number of industries rely on fire alarm and detection systems to prevent loss of life and and to minimize damage (and the resulting downtime) if a fire does occur.
Types of Systems
From conventional and addressable control panels to mass notification systems, Encore engineers and technicians can design and install a fire alarm system appropriate for your facility, special equipment, and specific industry. We also offer 24/7 emergency service and system maintenance programs, and also can test and inspect your existing fire alarm system per your state’s requirements. Encore is a licensed distributor of top brands in fire protection, including Gamewell-FCI. Encore also provides fire alarm solutions from any manufacturer you choose ensuring you get the right technology to protect your assets.
Conventional Systems – A standard offering in the fire protection industry, this type of system offers individually-wired panels, perfect for smaller rooms or facilities.
Addressable Systems – For larger buildings or multi-site facilities, Addressable Systems connect alarm devices through a shared panel, notifying and directing you to the triggered device(s).

Fire Sprinklers: Ensure Quality and Safety
With more than 30-years experience, Encore is one of the oldest and most experienced fire protection companies in New England. Our team is equipped to design and install your buildings’ fire sprinkler system or provide test and inspection services for the system already in place.
Considered the most reliable fire protection system available, fire sprinklers are made up of a network of piping which carry pressurized water that discharges through sprinkler heads when the effects of a fire have been detected. According to NFPA, the vast majority of fires are contained with just 1 to 2 sprinkler heads activating.
Properly installed and maintained fire sprinklers are effective over 96% of the time and prevent widespread damage to your facility. Unfortunately, as recently as 2011, the National Fire Protection Association reported that only 10% of structural fires had properly maintained sprinklers present which lead to many cases of needless property damage and even injury and loss of life. Ensuring your facility’s fire sprinkler system is up to current codes and properly maintained is critical to mitigating the significant liability that fire conditions present every day.
Types of Fire Sprinkler Systems and Components
Encore is the expert in the design and installation of all makes and models of fire sprinkler equipment. Our team of trained technicians can keep you in compliance through our testing and inspection services, and are available for 24/7 emergency service to keep your business up and running. We are licensed distributors of some of the leading fire sprinkler manufacturers, including Tyco, Ferguson, Reliable, Victaulic, and Viking, and can design a system that is right for your facility.
Wet Systems – The simplest, most common method of fire sprinkler systems, wet systems consist of pipes that contain pressurized water that is deployed when fire or high temperatures are detected.
Dry Systems – Pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, rather than water and are often used where system piping will be exposed to freezing temperatures. This air holds a remote valve in a closed position. The remote valve prevents water from entering the pipe until a fire causes a sprinkler head to activate releasing the air, opening the remote valve and delivering water to the activated sprinkler
Fire Pumps – Fire pumps, usually powered by an electric, or diesel source, and drawing water from a public or private water supply, are used properly feed a sprinkler system when water pressure is not adequate.
Sprinkler Heads – A key component to ensure effective heat detection and the release of water once a fire has been detected, it is important to ensure all sprinkler heads remain functional and compliant.
Standpipes – This series of pipes connect to fire hose stations located throughout a building, allowing fire firefighters to access the water supply in the event of an emergency.
Deluge Systems – Used in highly hazardous areas such power plants and processing facilities, deluge systems deploy water with a rapid, heavy response to extinguish fires.
Pre-Action System – A two-step system that first identifies smoke, fire, or heat, pre-action systems then activate a pre-action valve that releases water flow onto the affected area. This two-step system is used in sensitive areas where water damage could be costly.
Encore also offers: Jockey pumps, fire hydrants, foam systems, and backflow preventers.
Regulations and Compliance
Our team is OSHA trained, licensed, and certified to install and service systems in all six New England states. Each product and service offered by Encore is also compliant with the following:

Fire Suppression: Meeting Unique Safety Challenges
Fire Suppression Systems offer a wide range of response to extinguishing fires in the most challenging hazard areas where a traditional water system would cause too much damage or down time.
When properly designed, installed, and maintained, the breadth of fire suppression technologies available today gives facilities the flexibility they need to balance both fire safety and compliance with the preservation of expensive equipment and other valuables. When water cannot do the job, or would cause too much damage and downtime, fire suppression is the answer.
New technologies exist that can protect assets such as specialized production equipment, data centers, MRI machines, telecommunications towers, and priceless works of art that are either critical to business uptime or are irreplaceable. The development of cutting-edge, clean agent, wet and dry chemical (waterless) fire suppression systems significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage. Fire suppression systems are found in a variety of facilities including high-hazard industrial, archive storage, medical and healthcare, restaurants, marine, fuel storage, transportation, museums, and historical sites.
Types of Systems
Encore’s engineered and pre-engineered suppression systems provide needed protection from the many unforeseen threats caused by human error all the way up to natural disasters.
Clean Agent Systems
Inergen (or Inert Gas) – A non-toxic system composed of naturally-occurring gases that is designed to protect valuable or sensitive assets that would be otherwise damaged by conventional agents.
FM-200 – A waterless fire suppression system that is quickly deployed in an emergency and won’t leave behind residue, particulate, or water.
Equipment Specific Clean Agent System – Systems such as Firetrace use clean agent to protect your high-value equipment without the cost of protecting an entire space.
High Pressure CO2 –This system allows for multiple discharges with minimal downtime and is often used to protect multiple spaces where there is a high risk of fire. Commonly used in manufacturing, printing, energy and chemical storage.
Low Pressure CO2 –This system has similar benefits to High Pressure CO2 and also give the increased ability to cover larger and even multiple hazards at the same time.
Halon – One of the original clean agent systems, they have the similar fire-fighting capabilities as Inergen, Novec, and FM-200, though are no longer produced due to ozone depletion caused by the agent. If you have these systems in place, it is important they are serviced by experts.
Aerosol Systems – This is a cost effective clean agent alternative for certain hazard areas such as elevator control and electrical rooms.
Liquid/Foam-Based Systems
Ansul Foam Systems – These systems discharge foam into an enclosed space, surrounding the hazard. Little water is required to generate large quantities of expanded foam, which minimizes the potential for water damage.
Encore also offers: Deluge, Pre-Action, and Water Mist Systems
Kitchen Systems
Kitchen fires are the number one cause of commercial fires in the United States, with 57 percent of all restaurant fires involving cooking equipment. This causes nearly a quarter-billion dollars in property damage and even more costly downtime to 8,000 eating and drinking establishments each year. Prioritizing restaurant fire safety is paramount to prevent harm to employees, customers, and property. To ensure you are up to date with local and federal regulations, while preventing interruptions to your business, Encore will work with you to design, install, and maintain a UL300-compliant kitchen suppression system that is right for you.
Gas & Service Station Systems
Service stations run a high risk of fire due to the flammable conditions that exist, with one in every 13 service stations experiencing a fire or Encore’s licensed technicians can develop a fire detection and suppression system that can immediately mitigate any fires at the
Industrial Dry Chemical
Dry Chemical Fire Suppression systems are pre-engineered to combat fire damage in industrial applications such as paint spray booths, dip tanks, and other locations where hazardous materials may be stored. These systems feature mechanical or electrical detection options and either ABC or BC chemical agents.
In the case of a spray booth, it is important to consider the composition of the hazardous material being applied (paint) as well as the object that is being coated. We will conduct a full hazard survey to properly identify the type of fire to be contained and the applicable regulatory codes for compliance: NFPA 17, NFPA 30, NFPA 33, and NFPA 72.
Frequently Asked Questions
If you are still unclear on the best suppression system for your facility, or whether a traditional extinguishing system may be sufficient, then you should call our team of suppression experts to discuss the full range of options that exist.
What are the benefits of a clean agent system vs. a traditional foam based system?

Fire Extinguishers: Simple Safety
Fire extinguishers are the first line of defense in the event of a fire, largely due to their accessibility and portability in any space. Per NFPA, your fire extinguishers are required to be inspected monthly and maintained annually, keeping your facility safe and compliant. Portable extinguishers should be readily available in all areas of your facility, especially in the kitchen or cooking areas, electrical panels or closets, chemical storage areas, trash areas, restrooms, and other locations with a high risk of fire.
Fire extinguishers are classified by type and rating, and it can be difficult to know where to start when selecting the proper type to fit your needs. Encore can perform an evaluation of your facility and identify the specific types of fire extinguisher with the proper rating to best suit your needs. Below is a quick reference:
Clean Agent Hand Portables — These units use a gaseous agent to deplete oxygen around a fire, and are intended to leave minimal residue, thus extinguishing the fire and limiting damage to expensive equipment that ordinary liquid or powder extinguishers may cause.
Stored-Pressure Water Hand Portables — Ideal for Class A fires involving common combustibles, this model allows for easy, cost-effective recharging.
Wheeled Portable Extinguishing Units — These units are for larger hazards, usually used in commercial facilities with el5mb_6h20_lgevated hazards. They are equipped with a long hose and are mounted on a wheeled cart to allow for easy transportation of extinguishing agent quantities. These units can contain any type of extinguishing agent, Dry Chemical, Wet Chemical, Clean Agent and Foam.

Property & Facility Management
As a facility manager, your primary focus is to mitigate liability and ensure the safety and security of your tenants, employees, and visitors. Yet, with robust systems in place, maintaining such complex systems can often be a burden on property managers who are forced to balance tight budgets with maintaining compliance. From high-rise buildings to office parks, shopping centers to stand-alone storefronts, apartment buildings to hotels, Encore can design and install the appropriate fire alarm and suppression systems to meet building and fire code requirements. New technologies, including intelligent fire alarm systems that incorporate early detection, mass notification, and early communications, can expedite response to potential hazards. Encore can also implement testing and inspection programs that bring your systems and equipment, including fire extinguishers, into full compliance and guarantee full-functionality should an emergency arise.

Within the world of education, from nurseries and daycare facilities to elementary and secondary schools to colleges and universities, students, faculty, and administrators face many safety threats each day. In addition to fire hazards, they are vulnerable to intruders and violence that can result in injury, casualty, and property damage. Though current NFPA standards for education are already strict, changes to NFPA codes in 2018 will include substantial updates to campus security and fire safety requirements. Encore can work with facility managers in education to design, install, test, inspect and maintain the appropriate technology for any educational property, including integrated systems that unify fire detection and suppression, mass notification, and emergency communications at one facility or across a campus.
Medical & Healthcare
Healthcare facility managers are not only responsible for the care and wellness of patients, but also the safety and service of sophisticated medical equipment, laboratories, and data and EMR systems. Gas and oxygen cylinders, fire exit obstructions, and even kitchens are all hazards that can spark a potential catastrophe at any medical or healthcare facility. Compliance with the stringent NFPA and JCAHO standards are essential to licensure, certification, and accreditation. Encore’s technical specialists can design, install, test, inspect, and service fire safety systems for a variety of facilities, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, MRI and medical imaging facilities, clinical laboratories, and nursing homes, and ensure that your patients, staff, and equipment are properly protected, and that your facility is compliant with the appropriate standards.
Industrial & General Manufacturing
Nearly 37,000 structural fires at manufacturing facilities are reported annually, causing upwards of $20 billion in equipment and property damage. Such fires are caused by improperly maintained equipment, heating equipment, ignition of improperly stored flammable gases and liquids, electrical malfunctions, and human error. The majority of these fires are prevented or contained through the proper use of fire alarm, sprinkler, and suppression systems, and appropriately placed fire extinguishers throughout the facility. Encore’s in-house design team and our certified and licensed technicians can design and install fire protection systems for your manufacturing operations, as well as service, test, and inspect your systems to ensure that they are code-compliant and properly functioning.
IT & Data Centers
IT and data centers are mission critical to every organization, and any interruption can be catastrophic to your business operations and bottom line. Loss of data or connectivity can have a devastating economic impact, as would the loss of the equipment itself. New fire safety codes require IT and data centers to be protected above and beyond standard commercial and industrial regulations to ensure that data storage/retrieval systems, ranging from criminal and medical records, financial records and transactions, insurance and legal records, and registration databases, are properly protected at all times. From rack rooms to clusters to server farms, Encore can make certain that your organization is code- compliant, and design and install the most advanced fire detection and suppression technologies that monitor, mitigate and contain fire hazards, including air sampling smoke detection and clean agent systems.
Cultural & Historical Institutions
Preserving and protecting cultural and historical artifacts is critical for museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Paintings, statues, documents, and other collections are one of a kind and irreplaceable. And, what’s more is that the structures housing these fragile rarities are also historically significant and cannot afford to be damaged by fire. Encore offers a variety fire suppression systems with integrated fire detection and alarms that provide command and control benefits that minimize fire and water damage to collections and property and are minimally obtrusive to the architectural detail of the structure.
Construction
Construction sites of all sizes and types face a wide range of fire hazards, and like the wide range of hazards, the list of compliance codes and standards are far-reaching and extensive. In addition to NFPA, OSHA mandates specific requirements for implementing fire protection and training programs which focus on fire prevention and preparation for employees and contractors on a site. Encore works with construction companies, contractors, and building engineers to develop and deploy comprehensive fire safety systems, including training and installation of fixed and mobile fire suppression systems, to keep construction sites compliant.
