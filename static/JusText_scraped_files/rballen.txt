For our public customers; significant benefits can be realized by buying off the statewide contract known as COMM-PASS. COMM-PASS is the only official procurement record system for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Benefits include time savings as well as quality products at competitive prices. The State has already done the vendor screening and offers their program to all qualified public entities. The R.B. Allen Co., Inc. is proud to be included in several State contracts, one of which may be right for you. If you would like additional information on this program please contact us.
