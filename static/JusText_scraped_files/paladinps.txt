What are the 3 key metrics I should consider when planning technology rooms?
Goals and expectations for technology enabled rooms and tech utilization should be considered before planning begins. Metrics--Progress reporting on metrics allows for any necessary alterations or improvements after implementation.
Establish a base line from past projects. Begin monitoring. Be proactive in gathering results.
The number and frequency of meetings
How many meetings take place in each room?
Are teams favoring rooms that have specific technology?
In new meeting rooms with technology, does the usage of those rooms increase?
In meeting rooms without technology, has their use declined dramatically?
How to track real time statistics? A room scheduling system can track activity and frequency based on user IDs.
Development efficiencies
How long did it take to complete a project or get a new product to market in the past?
If teams start using collaborative spaces and technology, are projects being completed more rapidly?
Have some development costs or rework costs been avoided because of more cross-department collaboration?
Reduction in the number of iterations and tests
How many prototypes are required to get to your final result?
How much money is being spent on testing, trials or external evaluations?
If better collaboration can speed development through less iteration, there are real savings to be realized!
User Satisfaction----Surveys can be used for satisfaction scales and comment boxes. What are users saying about the functionality of the meeting rooms?
Similar to the usage questions, why are technology enabled rooms being booked or avoided?
Consider surveys that ask about and grade user acceptance, ease of use and overall satisfaction.
Ask for recommendations for improvement and accomplishments resulting from collaborative discussions. Monitor results regularly, especially user feedback, so improvements can be made.
Taking Stadium Sound to the Next Decibel
Outdoor sports facility operators may feel like their backs are up against a wall in terms of providing fans with intelligible sound. There are many factors that must be addressed including the size of the venue, location, and its acoustical quirks, as well as varying weather conditions. Each aspect will impact a sound system's design.
The audio components specified for outdoor applications must not only control what gets into them (rain, snow, pests) but what comes out of them, and managing sound in open-air venues presents challenges not faced with indoor sports applications. Temperature gradients can literally change with the wind and steer sound in any direction in an instant. This is a particular problem during night football games, as cool fall air sits over surface-level air that has been warmed all day by the sun.
Even in ideal weather conditions, sound will never be able to keep up with its video board counterpart - light - in terms of speed of travel. In a stadium that also has a video scoreboard, the proper design will synchronize the audio with your video. One solution uses a distributed system, speakers are located much closer to where the audience is seated.
Every stadium sound design is as unique as the stadium itself, and each comes with its own considerations. Budget for the project is also a consideration when planning a new sound system.
Our design team can develop a stadium and athletic field sound system that will be a complete audio solution for your stadium.
Stadium systems are designed by Paladin engineers as a custom solution for your specific needs and budget.
We can develop an outdoor stadium solution that delivers a consistent high-performance sound ideal for play-by-play announcements where vocal clarity and wide coverage is essential. Based on you budget, your system can be designed with high quality audio from simple voice projection to more sophisticated systems that provide clear intelligibility and music reproduction to spectators in all seating areas as well as the middle of the field, providing long throw coverage from anywhere in the stadium.
Paladin uses a wide variety of the best stadium speaker manufacturers such as Electro Voice, JBL, Atlas Sound and Community Loudspeakers to provide solutions to fit your needs and your facility. Speakers can be mounted on your press box, lighting poles and scoreboards.
The Paladin Team has worked on a wide variety of stadium venues and has extensive experience implementing custom Sound Systems in school stadiums for K through 12 and collegiate institutions as well as professional stadiums across the state of Ohio.
A wide variety of installations range from a simple headend upgrade consisting of wireless microphones, a DSP for processing and an upgraded power amplifier to push existing speakers to their maximum, or a full system setup of new high-powered speakers to provide the best sound coverage needed to give the entire crowd the performance they want.
No matter the size or configuration of the venue, small or large, the Paladin Team has a proven track record and expertise installing custom audio systems. Let our team provide a quality solution for your venue.

Community I Series - Outdoor Loudspeakers
High performance, high output modular loudspeaker systems with discreet styling in weather-resistant enclosures
Community R Series - Outdoor Loudspeakers
Full bandwidth, versatile high output music, voice and paging solutions for outdoor and indoor venues of any size or configuration
Audio System Facts About Football Stadiums
Press Box Speakers
The loudspeakers are mounted on the roof of a press box, preferably at least 16 feet above the highest row of seating
The bleachers are assumed to be 20 feet tall at the back row
Pole Speakers
The loudspeakers are pole mounted at least 25 feet above the back row based upon bleachers being 20 feet tall
Since the loudspeakers are mounted at a higher point, this system design provides more even home seating coverage than a press box design
Scoreboard Speakers
The loudspeakers are mounted to the scoreboard 25 feet above the ground based upon bleachers that are 20 feet tall at the back row (Atmospheric effects such as wind, diffraction, and excess high frequency attenuation are more likely to be noticed with this design)
Amplifiers
For maximum system performance and longevity, the loudspeakers must be properly powered to achieve the needed sound pressure level
Processing and Protection
To properly process, equalize and protect the loudspeaker systems, it is recommended to use a digital signal processor (Some amplifiers have built-in processing which may be adequate when properly programmed)
How Does a Sound Masking System Work?
Sound Masking is ambient background sound engineered to match the frequency of human speech for greater speech privacy. The current technology on Sound Masking does not cancel sound or eliminate all speech noise in an environment; it reduces how far away conversations can be heard and understood by others, called the radius of distraction.
Adding Sound Masking to a space actually makes the space seem quieter. It sounds counter-intuitive but it’s true. The added sound reduces the intelligibility of human speech. When you can’t understand what someone is saying, their words are less distracting — in fact, you probably don’t even notice them.
Sound Masking also makes a building seem quieter by raising the ambient noise level of an environment and making speech noise less intelligible and therefore less distracting.
Sound Masking Systems are Used in Applications Such As:
Open office environments
Conference Rooms
Health Care Facilities
Legal Offices
Government Offices
Education
Financial Environments
Waiting Rooms
Spas
How is Sound Masking Different Than White Noise?
Sound Masking is often mistakenly referred to as “white noise”. However, unlike white noise, Sound Masking is specifically engineered to match the frequencies of human speech and to sound comfortable, even pleasant, to the human ear. When implemented properly, Sound Masking should just fade into the background “hum” of a workplace while simultaneously making speech more difficult to hear and understand.
Corporate Offices feature a variety of workspaces that require their own unique solutions for improving worker comfort, productivity, and speech privacy. Modern open offices contain far more reflective materials, such as glass and wood, than ever before. While these changes have made workplaces more aesthetically pleasing and collaborative, it has also affected the acoustics.
Our Pro Audio Team can create a custom solution that will help improve the acoustic environment of your facility. Sound Masking also helps protect sensitive and secure verbal communications from being over heard.
Paladin works with Cambridge, the leading supplier of Sound Masking equipment. Our team of sound engineers are ready to design a custom Sound Masking System to improve your environment.

Cornell 4200 Series System
The 4200 Series can be sized from 4 to 20 zones in multiples of 4 zones. Only one Master Control Panel is required. The system communicates to the remote 911 center via text and pre-recorded voice messages only. Two-way voice communication to the call stations is available from the master panel but not from the 911 center.
This area of rescue system offers different designs for a range of applications and is designed to resist vandalism and to prevent false alarms. As a world leader in emergency call system technology, Cornell Communications is committed to developing reliable emergency communications systems and helping hospitals, nursing homes and public buildings maintain compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires an Area of Refuge Assistance System in all newly constructed multi-story commercial buildings and public accommodations.
Cornell 4800 Series System
The 4800 Series Digital Emergency Communication system was developed to meet the requirements of the International Building Code (IBC) adopted by the US in 2015. It supports up to 255 call stations and 5 master panels; lending itself to larger buildings. It also provides for two way voice communication both in the building and with the 911 Center.
BDA Systems
Is your facility prepared for emergency situations? During an emergency, reliable radio signal coverage is absolutely critical to every first responder!
In many buildings, radio signals are adversely affected due to factors such as low-e glass, concrete, metal, RF interference, and below ground structures. Any of these can cause poor in-building radio signal coverage and/or dead spots.
If emergency first responders lose communications, the result can be deadly. Firefighters, EMS, law enforcement officers, and other first responders all rely on two-way radios for communication in everyday operations.
The International Fire Code (IFC) and the NFPA both require an “approved level of radio coverage.”
Does your building have Dead Spots? Is your facility in compliance with local jurisdiction regulations?
The Solution: Enhance your in-building radio frequency signal coverage with a Bi-Directional Signal Booster & Distributed Antenna System (BDA). Comba Signal Boosters and BDA Systems are designed and professionally installed by Paladin to provide a complete integrated solution to clients of all sizes.
Comba's CriticalPoint 700MHz/800MHz BDAs are designed for use with public safety-first responders in mind. Fully compliant with the IFC and NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), CriticalPoint's BDAs are offered in 0.5W, 2W or 5W of downlink power per band depending on the size of the building that needs to be covered. The features don't stop there.
The unit also includes comprehensive alarming capabilities, which supports all NFPA and IFC required monitoring and alarming, and also provides local and SNMP based remote monitoring.
The built-in signal generator and isolation testing function provide great convenience to system integrators during deployments.
Finally, the unit can be ordered either AC or 48V DC powered, allowing for flexibility depending on the design of the system.

The Paladin Inspection Team is not limited by manufacturer or facility/project size as we service most major brands.
After years of performing inspections, we have separated ourselves from the rest of the industry. How has our team done this? Through our focus on customer satisfaction. After listening to our customers’ needs and wants, we have developed a program that provides them with one source to manage all of their inspection needs. So, what does this mean to you as a customer? Our customers no longer need to coordinate with multiple inspection contractors to keep facilities current with today’s Life Safety needs. Let us do the heavy lifting as we will monitor your inspections needs and contact you when your inspections are due. During this process, we will coordinate our Inspection Team around your facility’s scheduling requirements. We will also contact your local AHJ (Authority having Jurisdiction) and notify them when the inspection will commence as required by NFPA (National Fire Protection Association).
The separation does not stop there however. In 2016, our President at Paladin implemented a Cloud Based Inspection System called eVance by Honeywell to better serve all of our client’s needs. The implementation of this system eliminates the need to store or file paper copies of inspection results on premise, as you can simply access all of your inspection records in the cloud from anywhere, at any time, via a connected device. The eVance Cloud Based Inspection System contains a list of all inspection points that our Paladin Team needs to “Pass” or “Fail” which reduces the risk of missing critical inspection points during the process.
Let us move your inspection reports into the new age of document recording! Paladin offers all of our customers this web-based inspection reporting option. This system allows our team to customize the inspection reports to meet your specific facility and insurance requirements allowing you to easily keep your reports organized in one location. Our representatives are available to answer any questions that you may have regarding this system.
One of Paladin’s core values is “Communication” and our inspection process supports the value to communicate at a high level with our customers on every aspect of their inspections.
Our Team provides the following Inspection Services:
Fire Alarm System Inspections
Sprinkler System Inspections
Fire Extinguisher Inspections
Emergency Light Inspections
Kitchen Hood Inspections and Cleaning
Fire Pump Inspections
Backflow Prevention Inspections
Hydrant Inspections
And More!!
Let Paladin be your “One Source” for all of your inspection needs! Call us today at 800-332-0603 to schedule your next inspection.
Q) What is expected after a Kitchen Hood Inspection is performed? A) After the inspection is completed, tags are applied to the system to provide verification of when the Kitchen Hood was inspected and what company provided the inspection. This is required in case your facility is ever inspected by the local Fire Marshall. A report is also generated which indicates all of the results as well as recommendations for any repairs that may be needed.
Breakdown of a Full Kitchen Hood Inspection
Check for visual signs that the system has been fired, tampered with or leaked. Disconnect system for inspection. (Paladin will alert personnel, Central Station Monitoring Center and Fire Department before testing begins.)
Check the cylinder condition and hydrostatic test date. Check the regulator test date of the system, if applicable.
Check all piping and conduit to verify they are secure and properly mounted. Verify the pipe and nozzles are free of blockage and properly aimed at appliance surfaces.
Replace all fusible links. If a system is electrical, test the detectors, the control panels and the battery back-up to ensure proper functionality. (Fusible links should be replaced on a semi-annual basis.)
Perform a dry test of the system for automatic operation and manual release.
Check operation of gas shut-off and/or electrical shut-off
Confirm the fuel shut-off is in the “ON” position. Weigh and replace fire system cartridges as required.
Check chemical type and quantity.
Verify the filter type in the Kitchen Hood and proper decals at the remote pull stations are in place.
Complete the Inspection Report and attach inspection tags. Check for proper type of portable Fire Extinguishers are in the Kitchen area (K Class) and verify they have been properly inspected.
According to the NFPA.org, if a fire is going to start, it’s likely to start in a Kitchen. Don’t let your Kitchen facilities go under-protected from fire. Regular cleaning of Kitchen Hoods is recommended. Keep your employees, customers, visitors and property safe by calling Paladin’s Service Department at 800-332-0603 to arrange an inspection or cleaning of your Kitchen Hood System.
Inspection Process
Check Accessibility
Identify if a Fire Extinguisher is present in the area and take note if it is easily visible.
It should not be blocked by any equipment or other objects that would make it difficult to be accessed during an emergency.
Portable Fire Extinguishers, other than wheeled types, must also be secured in a specific location (e.g. inside an unlocked glass cabinet or a wooden box) to prevent them from being moved.
Examine its Physical State
Look for the Fire Extinguisher’s serial number and check if the Fire Extinguisher label is readable.
Check if the cylinder and other external metal parts are free of corrosion, dents, and other signs of damage.
Check the connection between the hose and cylinder is secure.
Inspect if there are cracks in the hose or leaks in the nozzle.
Check if the locking pin goes through the holes of discharge lever and handle, and if the pin is secured well by the seal. The pin locks the discharge lever and prevents accidental discharge.
Check the Pressure Gauge
Examine where the gauge needle is. A needle within the green zone is good. A needle in the left red zone means that the Fire Extinguisher is undercharged and warrants a recharge, while a needle in the right red zone signals a danger of being overcharged.
Update Inspection Tag
The tag should indicate that a Fire Extinguisher is regularly inspected.
Generate Report and Recommend Action if Needed
Once an inspection is completed, summarize observations/action plan. Make sure to sign off on the Fire Extinguisher inspection tag (if available) with your name/signature and date of inspection.
Maintenance Schedule
ABC/BC requires an internal maintenance every 6 years and a hydrostatic test every 12 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
Class K requires a hydrostatic test every 5 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
Halon requires an internal maintenance every 6 years and a hydrostatic test every 12 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
Halotron requires an internal maintenance every 6 years and a hydrostatic test every 12 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
FE-36 requires an internal maintenance every 6 years and a hydrostatic test every 12 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
Co2 requires a hydrostatic test every 5 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
Water requires a hydrostatic test every 5 years from the date that the Fire Extinguisher was manufactured.
**Any time that a Fire Extinguisher has been partially discharged, it needs to be completely recharged.
Central Station Monitoring
Quality Central Station Monitoring is a must. Paladin provides UL and FM approved Monitoring Services for both commercial and residential customers. Our wide portfolio of services allows us to provide Monitoring of your Fire Alarm, Intrusion, Elevators, and Area of Rescue Systems.

The Basic Functions of Monitoring:
Monitoring Systems communicate to a Central Station
If alarms are triggered, the Central Station will send notification to dispatch authorities
Commercial Fire Alarm Systems must use a Central Station, per NFPA 72 Ohio Fire Code, unless the facility has their own Monitoring Station approved by the local AHJ
Some Key Facts on Monitoring:
Fire Alarm or Sprinkler System Monitoring is required in most circumstances
If your facility is always maned and monitored by two people 24 hours a day, your facility would be exempt. If your facility does not meet the above criteria, it will need to be monitored by a UL Central Station
If a False Alarm Sounds:
Contact your Central Station Monitoring company to notify them of any false alarms

How often does my Fire Alarm System need to be inspected?
The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) requirements differ from facility to facility. Most facilities will require an Annual Inspection of the entire Fire Alarm System as per Chapter 14 of NFPA and minimally a Semi-Annual Inspection of system batteries. Reference (NFPA 14.4.3.2 item 9 inspection 4)
It is important to note; some insurance companies have additional requirements that need to be factored into each inspection. Paladin recommends contacting your insurance company to provide you with their specific requirements for your facility.
After you have gathered the required information, contact our certified Inspection Team and they will determine the best type of Inspection for your facility

Yes. As per National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Chapter 26, all systems shall be monitored by a UL Central Station that is supervised by a minimum of two qualified operators on duty at all times. Reference (NPFA 26.4.5.1)
Is a Fire Alarm System needed if I have a Fire Sprinkler System?
If your building has a Sprinkler System, you will need some form of Fire Alarm System. The type of Fire Alarm System will be based on many other factors. Our certified team of Fire Alarm Designers will need to determine the architectural elements of your facility. Once we have a clear understanding of the use of your facility, we can then develop the proper design using the Ohio Basis Building Code to comply with current requirements.
My Fire Alarm Panel is in trouble and is indicating a Line One/Two Failure. What does that mean?
A Line One/Line Two Failure trouble indicates that the Fire Alarm Panel is not communicating with your Central Monitoring Station service. (Your panel will be communicating over a dedicated set of phone lines.) Confirm that you have good communications to the Fire Alarm Panel on both phone lines.
If your facility has experienced problems with your phone system, that is most likely the cause of the problem. If you cannot identify the problem or have communications to the Fire Alarm Panel but the trouble still exists, call Paladin at 800-233-9500 to schedule a service visit with one of our certified Fire Alarm technicians.
My Fire Alarm Panel is in trouble and is indicating a Loss of AC Power. What does that mean?
A Loss of AC Power trouble indicates the Fire Alarm Panel is operating on battery only. First, check to make sure that the panel has AC power. If it does not, you will need to contact a licensed electrician for service. This type of trouble is often caused by lightning or power surges within the facility.
If this is the case, call Paladin today at 800-233-9500 to schedule a service visit with one of our certified Fire Alarm technicians.
My Fire Alarm Panel is in trouble and is indicating a Communications Failure. What does that mean?
A Communications Failure trouble indicates the Fire Alarm Panel is not communicating with your Central Station Monitoring Service. Your Fire Alarm Panel should be communicating either over your network or through a dedicated set of phone lines. Confirm that you have good communication paths to the Fire Alarm Panel.

First, locate the acknowledge button on the panel. Press the button on the panel to continue and it will take you through all the trouble indicators that are currently on the panel.
Call Paladin today at 800-233-9500 to schedule a service visit with one of our certified Fire Alarm technicians.
Why is my Fire Alarm Panel beeping?
If your Fire Alarm Panel is beeping, it is because it is in an “Alarm” or “Trouble” condition. A red light on the panel display indicates the panel is in an alarm condition. If a yellow/amber light is on, this indicates a trouble condition.
Is a Maintenance Contract required on my Fire Alarm System?
Although a Maintenance Contract is not required, it is a best practice to have Paladin’s Certified Notifier technicians working on your system to keep it performing correctly. Training and product certifications are a must when working on today’s Notifier Fire Alarm Systems. Notifier certifications are only provided to authorized dealers.
Paladin also extends Equipment Warranties to customers that purchase Service and Maintenance Contracts. Our contract program affords you the ability to budget inspections and any needed repairs.

“Our Team, Your Project, One Goal”
History of Paladin
On January 1, 1990 Cal Corsi and a partner opened the doors to Paladin Protective Systems from a small storefront office in Garfield Heights, Ohio. They specialized in the service and installation of security systems.
From the start, the strength of Paladin has been the ability to exceed customer's expectations with top notch quality of service completed on a timely basis. Paladin's high employee retention allowed our customers to become familiar with the staff members selling, designing, installing and servicing their systems. The key to Paladin's success was our slow constant growth in order to manage the infrastructure to the company. As our workload increased, more employees joined the Paladin team. -
In 1994, Paladin formed Paladin Professional Sound. With the development of the Professional Audio Video side of the business, Paladin started growing and expanding out of the Cleveland area and finding projects across the state of Ohio.
In 1995, Paladin continued to grow and found that the small storefront office on Garfield Boulevard was no longer sufficient to house employees and inventory storage. It was at this time that Paladin decided to purchase the Old Fire House #11, in Cleveland, Ohio. By 1997, Paladin remodeled the Fire Station and moved into their new headquarters. Paladin also opened a second office in Worthington, Ohio, just north of Columbus, which is still in operation.
By December of 2008, Paladin outgrew the Fire Station and needed to expand. This is when the current Headquarters in Valley View was purchased. Currently, Paladin employs over 60 people and continues to grow year after year.
