Fire & Smoke Controls
Keeping your fire and smoke control systems current and up to code isn’t just about following the law. It’s about keeping your people – your most valuable resource – safe.
Keeping your fire and smoke control systems current and up to code isn’t just about following the law. It’s about keeping your people—your most valuable resource—safe.
At VSC Fire & Security, protecting people from fire hazards is what we do. It’s right there in the name. When a fire looms, we’ve got the know-how to design, install, repair, and inspect the systems that guide emergency personnel in and get your people out.
Explosion Protection Systems
Just because an explosion could happen on the job doesn’t mean it should. That’s why we design, install, repair and inspect explosion protection systems that work hard to prevent disaster. And if the worst happens – an explosion occurs despite all your safeguards – then our systems will help keep the most-dire effects in check.

Potential fire sprinkler system corrosion and water damage costs include:
Damage to or loss of interiors walls and floors, equipment, furnishings
Threat of mold growth
Damaged products and/or data storage

We’ve got the collective expertise to do it all. In fact, if you run a mission critical facility like a hospital, data center, or military installation, we can perform onsite remediation and management services while your equipment is running—so your operation continues without any downtime.

Whether we designed your fire protection systems or not, we’ll inspect the ones you’ve got—though you’ll get a better deal if you design, install, and inspect with VSC.

Knox FDC Protection Program
The Knox FDC Protection Program is a complete system that provides protection for both the intake and discharge sides of water-based fire protection systems. This secure, high-quality system provides fire department control over FDC equipment at no cost to your department. When you adopt the FDC Protection Program, Knox Keywrenches are provided to your department at no charge. Building owners in your jurisdiction will be able to purchase Knox FDC Locks™ along with Knox Standpipe Lock™ and Knox Storz Lock™ products. The first shipment of FDC products will be sent after an authorized fire department member has received the Knox Keywrenches.
Secure Fire Protection Systems
Unlike other non-secure FDC caps, Knox locking FDC products protect FDCs from getting clogged or vandalized, ensuring quick access to supplement fire sprinklers in an emergency. Knox FDC Lock removal is quickly and easily accomplished with a Knox Keywrench. The universal Keywrench allows for rapid access to FDCs, while lowering maintenance costs to owners due to unnecessary back flushing from clogged pipes.
Reduce Theft of Brass Connections
In recent years, communities have seen an increase in stolen copper and brass including siamese brass FDC swivel connections. A stolen FDC connection places a building, its occupants and responders at risk. To combat the theft of FDC swivel connections, Knox has developed the Knox FDC Lock with Swivel-Guard™ that covers the entire swivel connection and minimizes the potential of the connection being stolen. With Swivel-Guard™, the set screw is inaccessible making it difficult to remove the brass connection.
Protect Sprinkler System Performance
A fire sprinkler system is subject to malfunction and malicious attack when foreign matter, such as debris, trash or animal nests, enters the system through an unprotected FDC connection. Knox FDC, Storz and Standpipe Locks deliver clean FDC lines and undamaged connection threads.
Protect Water Source Against Theft
Water is a precious commodity. The Knox Standpipe Lock and Knox Storz Lock devices lock the connection to non-approved users providing protection against water theft and the potential introduction of harmful substances into the water system. Since both products hold water pressure, they can safely be installed on hydrants.

Enforce FDC Protection
Language in the International Fire Code (IFC), International Building Code (IBC) and NFPA 1 Fire Code all authorize the installation of locking FDC caps in your jurisdiction.
Knox FDC Protection Products
Sizes & Threads
In addition to National Hose Thread (NH), the Knox Company manufactures additional thread types as requested by fire departments. If your jurisdiction does not use NH (formerly referred to as NST) and you would like to confirm that Knox has your thread pattern in stock, just give your Knox representative a call. For Knox Storz Lock and Knox Standpipe Lock, if additional sizes are required, contact your Knox representative for availability.
Knox Keywrenches
Once your department has decided on the types of FDC protection products and thread patterns, Knox will deliver Keywrenches to your department. The Keywrenches are provided free of charge. All registered FDC departments are encouraged to request additional Keywrenches for their mutual aid departments. A special contractor registration form is also available if your department wishes to authorize local contractors to obtain Knox Keywrenches.
Trust Knox Locking FDC Caps to protect what matters when it matters.

Success Story

Honestly, I never thought I would make a career out of this industry – I always thought it was for men when I was a kid.
VSC has been part of my life as far back as I can remember. My dad would bring me to the Baltimore office on Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, and I’d learn more about what he and the other employees were working on. Though it didn’t seem important to a 10-year-old girl at the time, I still remember how much everyone seemed to enjoy what they were doing.
We moved to Charlotte when I was 14, and, about five years later, I was offered a part-time job to help the office manager – she was the only person doing the work that four women now handle. After a few months, she offered me a full-time admin job, and, not long after that, I was given the opportunity to get more involved in booking, billing and dispatching.
Our district was growing so fast that a few years later, when our lone inspections manager was overwhelmed, I was fortunate to be able to jump in and get hands-on experience with fire protection. That was when I realized this wasn’t “just a job” anymore.
Educating our customers, making sure they’re up to code and developing relationships has become what I am passionate about (and the fact that I also have awesome inspectors on my team doesn’t hurt either). Being at VSC feels like being part of a family. I’ve been with the Charlotte district for more than seven years now, and I still wake up excited for work. We have a blast, work hard and remain a team, even on the tough days. Everyone has their bad moments, their disagreements – but we meet, discuss and grow as a team. That’s what I love most about this company.
Working in an industry that protects lives, learning something new about these systems every day, and developing relationships and partnerships means I never once get bored! Hard work is rewarded, and I don’t plan on stopping where I am now. VSC continues to push me to move forward and better myself, and I will continue to do my very best for a company that absolutely deserves it.

I was working with a general contractor/developer in 1990 when they closed the doors on their Washington, D.C., office. I’d joined them right out of college and had been with them for five years when I found myself out of a job.
We still relied on newspaper help-wanted ads in those days, and I spotted one for an office manager position in the Springfield branch of Virginia Sprinkler. With five years in the construction industry under my belt, I thought I had a lot to offer this small but growing company – and apparently they agreed.
Twenty-seven years later, I’ve accumulated a lot of memorable moments at VSC. One that stands out is the 40th anniversary party that VSC had for all the branches at Busch Gardens. It was so nice to meet people from all of the branches and see what a large and diverse group we are; I still have some pictures from that day.
Another fond memory goes back to 1995, when I would spend a few days a week in the Baltimore office helping with the sudden transition of their general manager and office manager. The team in Baltimore was so cohesive and hardworking, yet they managed to have fun together at lunch time. They would all eat together and watch South Park. I thought it was such a great idea to unwind and laugh together, and I’m sure it helped them to work as a team to get through the difficult transition.
One memorable moment that is a little more personal was years ago, when one of our department managers suffered a serious illness. During the weeks of his rehabilitation, it was amazing to field all the calls from customers, vendors and associates who simply wanted to check up on him. He was truly loved.
I’ve stayed at VSC because I enjoy the work that I do here and feel I can still make a difference. I love the old familiar faces and the new ones; I feel as if we are one big family. And while things change enough to keep the job interesting, the overall company philosophy has stayed steady and true. It has been a wonderful company to work for.

I was getting sick of retail. In high school, I was a photo lab tech at a mall, which led to selling cameras. After that, I was a manager at a popular clothing store and then a stock boy at a lingerie store. No surprise: I was getting burned out. But my uncle was a VSC employee, and he’d had a good experience, so I decided to try something more labor-intensive and fulfilling than the grind at the mall. That was 14 years ago.
Once I learned a trade, I realized the importance of having a skill in a specialized field. The work is honest, and the benefits and insurance are excellent.
I started working here when I was 20. Back then, I wasn’t sure this line of work was for me, but, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve seen friends and peers struggle with jobs because the hospitality field is fickle. I’ve felt secure in my position here at VSC and have come to realize how valuable and rare that kind of security is. When you’re younger, you’re not worried about things like insurance and a 401(k), but life changes. My wife and I are expecting our first child, and we plan to make full use of our insurance! That wouldn’t be possible without the support I have with VSC.

Markel Ventures has added 20-plus companies to its roster in the past 15 years
Posted on August 12, 2021 by Cree Carter
If you’re eating a hamburger from a fast-food restaurant, there’s a good chance that Richmond-based AMF Bakery Systems had a hand in making the bun.
The company, which has a factory on Laburnum Avenue in Richmond, is part of a larger group of businesses called Markel Food Group that operates 10 factories around the world. Those factories manufacture equipment that AMF’s customers — industrial bakeries — use to produce billions of buns, crackers, cookies, pretzels and pizzas every year.
Ken Newsome, the CEO of Markel Food Group, said the company is about 15 times the size it was when he acquired it along with other local investors in 1997. The business has grown from about 125 employees to more than 800 around the world, including about 160 in the Richmond area.
Much of that growth has come since 2005, when AMF Bakery Systems was acquired by Henrico County-based Markel Corp., a Fortune 500 company whose primary and largest business is specialty insurance.
“Without the capital of Markel and the support of Markel, none of this would have happened,” Newsome said of the growth of Markel Food Group, which includes AMF Bakery Systems.
“We have made several substantial acquisitions along the way, and it was all their capital,” he said. “The Markel folks have been unbelievable partners. They are my counselors and advisers and coaches and friends.”
AMF Bakery Systems was the first acquisition for Markel Ventures, an investment arm of Markel Corp. that buys companies outside of the insurance business.
A little more than 15 years after Markel Ventures was created, the portfolio of businesses has grown to include 21 companies in industries as diverse as fire suppression systems, concierge medicine, construction, technology consulting, decorative plants and fashion leather handbags.
Ten of the Markel Ventures companies are based in the Richmond region.
Thomas S. Gayner, Markel Corp.’s co-CEO and the creator of the Markel Ventures business unit, said it wasn’t part of the strategy to invest specifically in Richmond-area companies.
Markel Ventures has made acquisitions worldwide, but local companies are a significant part of the portfolio because many of its acquisitions have resulted from relationships that took years to develop.
For instance, with the first deal to buy AMF Bakery Systems, Gayner said he had known Newsome professionally and personally for some time.
“I trusted him and liked him, and the company [AMF] is in an industry that seemed like it was not going to be technologically disrupted,” Gayner said. “Bread has been around for thousands of years.”
“We were able to strike a deal to purchase AMF and keep it headquartered here in Richmond, and it just grew from that,” Gayner said.
“Once we did that deal, we gained credibility” as an option for other companies looking for a buyer, he said. “The phone started ringing.”
Since then, roughly half of the deals struck by Markel Ventures have come through a more traditional buyout structure involving investment bankers who reach out to Markel about potential acquisitions, Gayner said.
“But literally half of our deals have come about through person-to-person contact, with no intermediaries,” he said.
