DETECTION SYSTEMS
Don’t Leave Your Safety Up To Chance.
Fire Fighter’s professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to alert you at the first sign of a fire.
All system designs are reviewed by NICET (National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies) certified technicians, a recognized standard of excellence. Our field personnel are factory trained on the products we sell to ensure the very best service for our customers, from project concept to acceptance testing.
After installation, we continue to provide protection by regularly testing and inspecting your systems to make certain they are operating properly.
Fire Fighter Offers The Following Types of Detection Systems:
DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEMS
Building fire alarm systems range from small, conventional systems to large computer-based intelligent, networked systems. Fire Fighter provides the analysis, design, and installation of systems best suited to provide a reliable, code-compliant, and cost-effective solution. We will furnish and install mass notification alerting systems for commercial, industrial, and education facilities in addition to the recommended fire alarm system for your property.
FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS
Our professional staff provides design, installation, programming and training of automatic detection and fire alarm systems to protect a wide variety of standard and special hazard systems.
VOICE EVACUATION SYSTEMS
The main difference between voice evacuation systems and a traditional fire alarm system is the spoken message voice evacuation systems use rather than strobes and sirens. The blare of traditional alarms can often be stressful, anxiety-provoking, and panic-inducing, causing a chaotic evacuation. The simple sound of an active alarm does not provide direction for evacuation and is limited to loud sirens and bright strobes lights. Voice evacuation technology helps diminish fear by guiding occupants out of the building using clear and coherent direction through the safest route.
MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS
A mass notification system can provide a multi-faceted approach to notify occupants and personnel of any type of emergency or non-emergency event in real time. We can provide the ability to easily integrate indoor and outdoor voice evacuation with pre-recorded messages or live announcements performed locally or via wide area networking over IP. Plus, the ability to integrate Distributed Recipient Mass Notification Systems (DRMNS) that deliver the appropriate message via text, email, SMS, digital displays, LED Signs and/or PC screens. Fire Fighter’s mass notification offering ensures that the right message is received by the right people, at the right time, using the appropriate technology.
MONITORING
Fire alarm monitoring is an essential part of a fire protection system. When a fire alarm goes off in your building, monitoring ensures that the signal is quickly assessed to verify that it is not a false alarm and then communicated to a first responder within minutes. Knowing that your fire alarm system requires monitoring is the first step to ensuring it will protect your building and your business if a fire ever breaks out. We offer 24-hour monitoring service for your fire alarm systems by means of cellular, IP (internet protocol) or POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service).
EQUIPMENT
Fire Fighter has a wide range of capabilities and access to different equipment to help ensure that we provide you the right fit for your specific applications.
