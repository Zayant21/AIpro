“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

This is how we're able to consistently provide Best In Class equipment and services.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

“Total Safety continues to succeed where others have struggled. I appreciate the MET (Most Effective Technology) discussions on additional opportunities for us to provide a safe and efficient turnaround - Real Time Data Reporting, Confined Space Video Monitoring, Remote Gas Detection and the multitude of tools which Total Safety has to offer. This is how we're able to consistently provide Best In Class equipment and services.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

This is how we're able to consistently provide Best In Class equipment and services.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining.

Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control.

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

Trusted by the best for Safety Solutions & Compliance
“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”

This is how we're able to consistently provide Best In Class equipment and services.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“Total Safety's dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and adaptability while supporting confined space entry and rope access rescue support, and confined space entry control during the inspection of the power tunnel and subsequent repair of the tunnel lining. Your team was always willing to step up to help the Inspectors, Engineers, and Contractors solve issues related to safety. Your team was able to manage the different facets of this project with no down time, while remaining flexible to changes that were beyond their control. I don't think I could give enough praise for what your team added to this project.”

“Thanks to Total Safety, we have another successful TAR in 2022. We first used Total Safety's SafeTek SmartMonitor system in 2019 and was pleased with the service, so we hired them again. Total Safety exceeded our expectations! We experienced a power outage during a vessel entry project, and Total Safety's SafeTek confined space monitoring system backup power immediately turned on and allowed us to complete the task without delay. Total Safety SafeTek technicians were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to provide us with important data and even video backup anytime we requested it day or night.”

“I confidently and without reservation recommend Total Safety. Total Safety's High Pressure Loop System was flawless. In addition to supporting approximately 100 personnel simultaneously under supplied air, they did so without sacrificing compliance or the health and safety or any personnel involved with the project. In addition the cost savings from implementing Total Safety's proven model, saved us more than $350K in labor costs alone. This does not include savings in equipment utilization models. In my experience working with Total Safety's team members, I can confidently say, each person espouses their Mission Statement of being committed …to ensure the safe Wellbeing of Workers Worldwide”
